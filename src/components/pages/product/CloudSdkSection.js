        Application developers rely on lots of open-core cloud services as part of their stack. Datastores, stream processing engines, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) services are common examples. However, application workloads are not limited to the secure confines of the data center anymore; Builders want to connect cloud
        services to applications running in devices at the edge!

      <Text>
        The Ockam Cloud SDK is crafted to create simple interfaces between cloud services, and edge applications. When cloud services include the Ockam Cloud SDK, cloud applications can trust messages sent from applications running in devices at the edge.
