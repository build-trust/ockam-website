        Kafka applications that are handling sensitive data require more than encryption to the

        network-level controls, and various other security approaches in an attempt to have a
        somewhat reliable assumption that only the intended app(s) were able to use the shared

        Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, or transmitting a

        opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's approach to secret{' '}

        means each secret key never needs to leave the place where it was generated. By removing the
        need to transmit secrets the risk of an attacker intercepting a secret in transit is also
        removed.
