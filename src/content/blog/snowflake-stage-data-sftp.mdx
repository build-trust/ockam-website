Wouldn't it be nice to access files in a Snowflake stage, using SFTP, as if they were locally mounted on your machine?
Wouldn't it be even better if it was not necessary to manage IP allow lists, open firewall ports, or setup services like PrivateLink? 
Would you believe me if I told you that it would take you less than 15 minutes to setup?

Introducing the Snowflake Stage Data with SFTP Connector!

## Snowflake ðŸ’™ SFTP

SFTP, the Secure File Transfer Protocol, is an ubiquitous protocol for securely transferring files,
based on the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions.

One way to import data into Snowflake is to use the [`snow` command line client](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) 
or the [`snowflake-connector-python` Python library](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install) to upload files and 
have them be mapped to tables for later processing. Unfortunately, both those tools require a specific installation, and an OAuth authentication,
whereas SFTP is installed on many Linux distributions and only needs SSH keys.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely access a Snowflake stage in your account, with SFTP, in just a few minutes. 
We will:

* Create a stage associated to your Snowflake account.
* Create a SFTP server on Snowflake with a private encrypted connection.
* Upload, list, download and remove files with SFTP commands.


![Snowflake stage data with SFTP](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-stage-data-sftp.png)


## Create a stage

This can be done with just a few commands in the Snowsight editor:
```sql
-- create a test database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SFTP_TEST_DATABASE;
USE DATABASE SFTP_TEST_DATABASE;

-- create a test schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SFTP_TEST_SCHEMA;
USE SCHEMA SFTP_TEST_SCHEMA;

-- create an internal stage
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS SECURE ENCRYPTION = (type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
```

The files contained in that stage can be listed with:
```sql
LIST @"SECURE";
```

And the stage should be empty for now!

## Setup a SFTP server inside Snowflake

We are now going to create a SFTP server for the previous stage inside Snowflake.
This will create a point-to-point connection between the two systems &mdash; without the need to expose
any systems to the public internet!

<ImageTour>
### !!steps Get the app

The Snowflake stage data with SFTP Connector by Ockam is [available in the Snowflake Marketplace - FIXME](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/TODO).

![!tour Get the app - FIXME](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/app-store.png)

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse to utilize to activate the app and can choose to change the application name.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool.

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/launch-app.png)

</ImageTour>

## Configuration

We are now going to configure the application. We first need to:

 - Create an Ockam project and issue an enrollment ticket
 - Create some SSH keys for both the SFTP server and the SFTP user.


<CodeTour>

### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash ! tour
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.


### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash ! tour
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will run alongside
the SFTP started by the "Stage data with SFTP - Connector" application, and provide one of the ends of our point-to-point connection.

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to
join the project that was just created. This node will run alongside the SFTP server, inside your Snowflake account:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute sftp \
  --relay sftp > sftp.ticket
```

### !!steps

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means
for an attacker to re-use it like an API token to access any system.

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute sftp \
  --relay sftp > sftp.ticket
```

### !!steps

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `snowflake`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute sftp \
  --relay sftp > sftp.ticket
```

### !!steps

The `--relay sftp` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows this
node to create a relay at the address `sftp`.

This relay will allow a SFTP client to establish a secure end-to-end
encrypted connection to the SFTP server, running in your Snowflake account, without requiring you to expose any
endpoints to the public Internet.

As the final part of this command we pipe the generated ticket to a file named `sftp.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute sftp \
# !focus(1:1)
  --relay sftp > sftp.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

## Generating SSH keys

In order to setup both the SFTP server and the SFTP client, we will need to generate three SSH key pairs:

- One pair for the user.
- Two pairs for the server (we support both RSA and ED25519 signatures).

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Generate the user keys


This command generates a private key in the `id_rsa` file and the corresponding public key in the `id_rsa.pub` file.

```bash ! tour
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa -N ""
```

### !!steps Generate the server ED25519 keys

This command generates a private key in the `ssh_host_ed25519_key` file and the corresponding public key in the `ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub` file.

```bash ! tour
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

### !!steps Generate the server RSA keys

This command generates a private key in the `ssh_host_rsa_key` file and the corresponding public key in the `ssh_host_rsa_key.pub` file.

```bash ! tour
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f ssh_host_rsa_key
```

</CodeTour>

## Configuring the application

<ImageTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Click "Get started" to open the Snowflake setup screen.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-get-started-app.png)

Take the contents of the file `sftp.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-ticket.png)

### !!steps Configure the stage access

In this screen, we need to enter:

 - The full name of the stage we want to access: `SFTP_TEST_DATABASE.SFTP_TEST_SCHEMA.SECURE`.
 - The name of a SFTP user which will access the server, for example `user`.
 - The public SSH key which we generated earlier: paste the content of the `id_rsa.pub` file. 

![!tour Configure the stage access](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-configure-stage-access.png)

### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow
outbound connections to your Ockam project.

Toggle the `Grant access to egress and reach your Project` button and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`.

Toggle the `Grant access to your SSH host ED25519 private key` button and paste the contents of the `ssh_host_ed25519_key` file.

Toggle the `Grant access to your SSH host RSA private key` button and paste the contents of the `ssh_host_rsa_key` file.

![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-grant-privileges.png)


### !!steps Start the SFTP server

Press "Next" and wait for the SFTP server to start. Once started, you should be able to check the SFTP server logs,
and see that the server is listening on port 2222:

![!tour Start server](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-sftp/snowflake-start-server.png)

You can also notice a tab containing the logs for an Ockam node. That Ockam node is a portal outlet which:

  - Created a relay named `sftp` in the Ockam project.
  - Declares that only clients with the attribute `sftp-client` can access the relay.

</ImageTour>

## Connect the SFTP client

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Generate an enrollment ticket for the SFTP client

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the SFTP server.
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run on our local machine:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute sftp-client > sftp-client.ticket
```

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute sftp-client > sftp-client.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attested attribute of `sftp-client`, corresponding to the attribute expected by 
the Ockam outlet node started in your Snowflake account.

The ticket is then saved to a file called `sftp-client.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute sftp-client > sftp-client.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

<CodeTour> 

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're now going to pass the configuration for our local Ockam Node as a JSON file, so
save the configuration to the right into a file named `sftp.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "via": "sftp",
    "allow": "sftp",
    "from": "0.0.0.0:2222"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, instructing the node
to create a portal inlet. An inlet receives message sent to the local `from` address, encrypts them and 
forwards them to the project relay named `sftp`.

```javascript ! tour
{
// !focus(1:1)
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "from": "0.0.0.0:2222",
    "via": "sftp",
    "allow": "sftp"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We also define a policy to restrict which are nodes that are expected to be connected to our inlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow
other nodes that have the attribute `sftp` as part of their attested
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `sftp` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "from": "0.0.0.0:2222",
    "via": "sftp",
// !focus(1:1)      
    "allow": "sftp"
  }
}
```

### !!steps Start the Ockam inlet node

We can now finally start the Ockam inlet node with this command

```shell ! tour
ockam node create --configuration sftp.json --enrollment-ticket sftp-client.ticket
```

</CodeTour> 

## Testing the connection

<CodeTour> 
We are now ready to access our Snowflake stage, with SFTP, via a fully secure point-to-point connection!

### !!steps Create a file

Before connecting we create a file which will be uploaded to Snowflake

```shell ! tour
echo "Hello Snowflake!" > hello.txt
```

### !!steps Connect to the SFTP server

This command uses the `id_rsa` file containing the user private key, to connect the user `user` to the local address `127.0.0.1:2222`.

```shell ! tour
sftp -i id_rsa -P 2222 user@127.0.0.1
```

### !!steps Upload a file

This opens a SFTP session where we can enter our first SFTP command, a `put` command to upload the file to the `secure` stage
```shell ! tour
> put hello.txt /secure
```

### !!steps List files on the Snowflake stage

We can check that the file has indeed be uploaded by listing the stage contents from inside Snowsight
```sql ! tour
LIST @"SECURE";
```

### !!steps List remote filse

We can also list the contents of the stage from the SFTP session
```shell ! tour
> ls /secure
```

### !!steps Download a file

We can download that same file from the stage

```shell ! tour
> get /secure/hello.txt retrieved.txt
```

### !!steps Delete a file

And finally we can remove the file from the stage

```shell ! tour
> rm /secure/hello.txt
```

</CodeTour> 


## Next steps

In summary, we are now able to securely access the contents of a Snowflake private stage, without exposing any port to the
internet, with a few simple SFTP commands.
