What if I told you there was a way to stream all
those insights you've got in Snowflake in real-time back to the your private 
Kafka systems? That it'll
use private point-to-point connections that don't require you to manage IP
allow lists, open firewall ports, or setup services like PrivateLink, and that it
will take you less than 15 minutes to setup?

Introducing the Snowflake Push to Kafka Connector!

## Snowflake 💙 Apache Kafka

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions. 

After enriching the data and finding new insights, those insights need to
make their way back out to the other apps and business systems that can act 
upon them. Apache Kafka (and Kafka-compatible alternatives) is the system of
choice for building flexible, scalable, and reliable streaming platforms to 
connect data producers and consumers. Connecting to your Kafka broker can be
problematic depending on your network topology. It would be convenient to give
the broker a public address, but that's a significant increase in risk for a 
system that handles a lot of important data. Managing IP allow lists and updating
firewall ingress rules improves security but can be cumbersome to manage. 
Alternatives like PrivateLink are better, but they too can be cumbersome to
setup and require your systems to be on the same public cloud and in the same
region.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely
connect Snowflake to your private Apache Kafka broker, in just a few minutes. We will:

* Setup a Snowflake Stream to capture changes to a table in Snowflake
* Setup a managed Kafka cluster in AWS
* Connect Snowflake to Kafka with a private encrypted connection - without needing
to expose either system to the public internet!

The final architecture diagram will look like this:

![Snowflake push to Kafka](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/snowflake-push-kafka.png)


## Snowflake streams 

Snowflake streams are a way to capture every change made to a table (that is, every
insert, update, and delete) and record it somewhere else. You may hear it called
Change Data Capture (CDC) and it's an effective way to respond to changes 
in the data that you care about. 

### Create a stream

<CodeTour>

### !!steps

Run the code here in a Snowflake worksheet. It will create a new table, and then
create a stream attached to that table.

```sql ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers (
  id number(8) NOT NULL,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM customers_stream ON TABLE customers;
```

### !!steps 

This section creates a new table, or replaces an existing one, to hold 
details about our customers. If you've already got a table within Snowflake
that you want to create a stream on you can skip this step.

```sql ! tour
--!focus(1:5)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers (
  id number(8) NOT NULL,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM customers_stream ON TABLE customers;
```

## !!steps 

Once we have a table, adding a stream to it is a single command where
we specific the name for the stream (`customers_stream`), and the
name of the table to attach it to (`customers`).

```sql ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers (
  id number(8) NOT NULL,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

--!focus(1:1)
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM customers_stream ON TABLE customers;
```

</CodeTour>

## Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)

We're going to provision an MSK cluster so we can see an end-to-end 
experience of data moving from Snowflake to Kafka. If you have an existing Kafka 
broker you're able to use you can skip this step.

### Create an MSK cluster

<ImageTour>

### !!steps

Within your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) search for 
`MSK` in the search field at the top and select the matching result. Visit the 
`Clusters` screen, and then click `Create Cluster`.

The `Quick Create` option provides a good set of defaults for creating a
Kafka cluster, so unless you've previous knowledge or experience to know you
might want something different I'd suggest just confirming the details and 
then clicking `Create cluster` at the bottom of the screen.

Once you've started the cluster creation it may take about 15 minutes for
provisioning to complete and for your broker to be available.

## Connect Snowflake to Kafka

We've created a stream, Kafka is running. It's now time to connect the two! The
next stage is going to complete the picture below, but creating a point-to-point
connection between the two systems &mdash; without the need to expose any systems
to the public internet!

![Snowflake push to Amazon AWS Kafka](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-complete.png)

<ImageTour>
### !!steps Get the app

The Snowflake Push to Kafka Connector by Ockam is  
[invite only](mailto:hello@ockam.io?subject=Invite%20for%20Push%20to%20Kafka%20Connector),
to get an invite please drop us an email at [hello@ockam.io](mailto:hello@ockam.io?subject=Invite%20for%20Push%20to%20Kafka%20Connector).

Once invited you'll receive an email with a link to get the app.

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse where
to install the app. This will determine where the to provision the required
compute resources for the Kafka Connector.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool. 

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the 
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need 
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/launch-app.png)

### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment 
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.

![!tour Get started](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/get-started.png)

### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will 
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

![!tour Setup admin account](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/get-started-enroll.png)

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Kafka

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will run alongside
our Kafka broker, and provide one of the ends of our point-to-point connection.

![Amazon MSK setup screen](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-kafka-setup.png)

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to 
join the project that was just created. This node will run alongside the 
Kafka broker, in the network where the Kafka is running:

```bash
ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 \
  --expires-in 24h --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

![!tour Create outlets](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/create-outlets.png)

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>

### !!steps 

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage 
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and 
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low 
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means 
for an attacker to re-use it like a credential to access any system. 

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's 
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with 
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and 
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `kafka`. 

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The `--relay kafka` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows this 
node to create a relay at the address `kafka`. 

This relay will allow your Snowflake warehouse to establish a secure end-to-end 
encrypted connection to your Kafka broker, without requiring you to expose any 
endpoints to the public Internet.

As the final part of this command we pipe the generated ticket to a file named `kafka.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute kafka \
# !focus(1:1)
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're going to pass the configuration for our Ockam Node as a JSON file, so 
save the configuration to the right into a file named `kafka.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, with the
first instruction being to create a relay with the name `kafka`. This relay will 
allow Snowflake to establish a secure end-to-end encrypted connection to your
Kafka broker. It provides the ability to have entirely isolated infrastructure 
running within a private network, without requiring you to expose any endpoints
to the public Internet and no configuring of allow lists to custom network routes.

```javascript ! tour
{
// !focus(1:1)
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

An outlet decrypts any messages received by the node and 
then forwards them to the specified broker address.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "kafka",
// !focus(1:4)  
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

In this example we're giving the interpolated value from the environment
variable `BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT`, which we'll set in a later step when we
start the node.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
// !focus(1:1)  
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We will setup the Kafka Inlet that runs alongside our Snowflake 
warehouse in a moment. Before we do that though, we can define a policy to restrict what 
nodes can connect to our outlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow 
other nodes that have the attribute `snowflake` as part of their attested 
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `snowflake` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
// !focus(1:1)      
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

</CodeTour>

### !!steps Launch Ockam node for Amazon MSK

The Ockam Node for Amazon MSK is a streamlined way to provision a managed Ockam Node
within your private AWS VPC. 

To deploy the node that will allow Snowflake to reach your Kafka broker visit
the [Ockam Node for Amazon MSK listing in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iztqd27voc4xg), and click the `Continue to Subscribe` button, and then
`Continue to Configuration`. 

On the configuration page choose the region that your Amazon MSK cluster is
running in, and then click `Continue to Launch` followed by `Launch`.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon MSK](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-marketplace-msk.png)

### !!steps Enter stack details

The initial Create Stack screen pre-fills the fields with the correct
information for your node, so you can press `Next` to proceed.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon MSK - create stack screen](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/create-stack.png)

### !!steps Enter node configuration

This screen has important details to you need to fill in:

* **Stack name:** Give this stack a recognisable name, you'll see this in various locations in the AWS Console. It'll also make it easier to clean these resources up later if you with to remove them.
* **VPC ID:** The ID of the Virtual Private Cloud network to deploy the node in. Make sure it's the same VPC where you've deployed your Amazon MSK cluster.
* **Subnet ID:** Choose one of the subnets within your VPC, ensure MSK has a broker address available in that subnet.
* **Enrollment ticket:** Copy the contents of the `kafka.ticket` file we created earlier and paste it in here.
* **Amazon MSK Bootstrap Server with Port:** In the client configuration details for your Amazon MSK cluster you will have a list of bootstrap servers. Copy the `hostname:port` value for the Private endpoint that's in the same subnet you chose above.
* **JSON Node Configuration:** Copy the contents of the `kafka.json` file we created earlier and paste it in here.

We've now completed the highlighted part of the diagram below, and our Kafka
broker node is waiting for another node to connect.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon MSK - node configuration screen](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/stack-details.png)

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

![Setting up Ockam Node as native Snowflake app](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-snowflake-setup.png)

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the Snowflake end. 
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run in our Snowflake warehouse:

```bash
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/snowflake-ticket.png)

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set 
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attestable attribute of `snowflake`. You'll 
recall in an earlier step we applied a policy to say that nodes in our 
project must have an attribute of `snowflake` to connect to 
the outlet. The node that enrolls with this ticket will also have the
attribute `snowflake`, and so it will be able to communicate with our Kafka 
node. 

The ticket is then saved to a file called `snowflake.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

</CodeTour>


<ImageTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Take the contents of the file `snowflake.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/snowflake-ticket.png)

### !!steps Map Snowflake stream to Kafka topic

Snowflake sends each stream of changes to a topic in Kafka, and we need to 
define the mapping between each stream and topic. Enter the stream you want to 
send (in the format of database.schema.stream), and then enter the name of the topic in Kafka.

If the topic doesn't exists the system will create it.

![!tour Map streams to Kafka topics](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/map-topics.png)

### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then 
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow 
outbound connections to your Ockam project. Toggle the 
`Grant access to egress and reach your Project` and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`.

![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/grant-privileges.png)

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Manually grant additional privileges

Not all the permissions the app requires have a toggle available
in the Snowflake UI, so you must manually grant some other permissions to allow 
the app to read the changes and send them to Kafka. This process can be
cumbersome and error-prone, involving copying, pasting, and modifying many lines. 
To simplify the process, we've created a stored procedure that you can call 
with the required values.

If you just want to get things working you can copy the code to the right and 
run it in a Worksheet to create the procedure and then skip to the next section. 
If you're curious to know what exactly the procedure is doing, let's walk through 
it line by line&hellip;

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];

    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Create a stored procedure

Here we're defining a stored procedure, written in JavaScript, that will return 
a string. The string output will be success or error message reporting on the
outcome of our commands. It expects a single string argument &mdash; the name of the 
stream.

```javascript ! tour
// !focus(1:3)
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Specify the app name

This is the name of Ockam's Snowflake Native App and we will use it in the 
locations where we specify which app is requesting permissions. 

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
// !focus(1:2)
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Lookup stream metadata

This function `getStreamMetadata` will take a stream name as a passed argument,
and then use the `DESCRIBE STREAM` command to get the stream metadata. The
function then extracts the `database_name`, `schema_name`, and `table_name`
associated with the stream and returns those values.

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

// !focus(1:14)
    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Error if no metadata

If the stream name provided doesn't exist it will return no metadata, and so 
we exit at this point with an error message.

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

// !focus(1:3)
    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Assign values

For a successful metadata lookup, we take the values out of the return metadata
object and assign them to individual variables.

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

// !focus(1:1)
    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

// !focus(1:3)
    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Define required permissions

Four separate permissions need to be manually granted for
each stream. One on the database, one on the schema, one on the table(s), and 
then one on the stream itself. We use the variables we assigned in the previous
section to interpolate the values into each command, and put those commands into
an array.

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

// !focus(1:7)
    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

### !!steps Grant permissions

The procedure will then loop over the array of `GRANT` commands and execute
each individually. If any command failures return an error message, 
otherwise you'll see a success message.

```javascript ! tour
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE grant_stream_permissions(STREAM_NAME STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS
$$
    // Define the fixed application name
    var APP_NAME = 'OCKAM_PUSH_TO_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_APP';

    // Function to get metadata by describing the stream
    function getStreamMetadata(streamName) {
        var sqlText = `DESCRIBE STREAM IDENTIFIER('${streamName}')`;
        var result = snowflake.execute({sqlText: sqlText});
        if (result.next()) {
            return {
                databaseName: result.getColumnValue("database_name"),
                schemaName: result.getColumnValue("schema_name"),
                baseTables: result.getColumnValue("table_name")
            };
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    var metadata = getStreamMetadata(STREAM_NAME);

    if (!metadata) {
        return `Stream ${STREAM_NAME} not found or no metadata available.`;
    }

    var DB_NAME = metadata.databaseName;
    var SCHEMA_NAME = metadata.schemaName;
    var BASE_TABLES = metadata.baseTables;

    // Construct the GRANT statements
    var grants = [
        `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ${DB_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ${DB_NAME}.${SCHEMA_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE ${BASE_TABLES} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`,
        `GRANT SELECT ON STREAM ${STREAM_NAME} TO APPLICATION ${APP_NAME}`
    ];
// !focus(1:10)    
    // Execute the GRANT statements
    for (var i = 0; i < grants.length; i++) {
        try {
            snowflake.execute({sqlText: grants[i]});
        } catch (err) {
            return "Error executing: " + grants[i] + ". Error: " + err.message;
        }
    }

    return "All grants executed successfully";
$$;
```

<br/> 

Now that you've created the stored procedure, it's time to run it. Copy the
code below and run it in a Snowflake Worksheet, replacing 
`database.schema.stream` with the correct value for your stream:

```sql
CALL grant_stream_permissions('database.schema.stream');
```

With that, we've completed the last step in the setup. We've now got a complete
point-to-point connection that allows our Snowflake warehouse to securely
push data through to our private Kafka broker.

![Snowflake push to Kafka setup complete](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-complete.png)

## Next steps

Any updates to your data in your Snowflake table will now create a new record in your 
Snowflake stream, which are then sent over your Ockam portal to your Kafka broker.
To see it in action insert a row into your Snowflake table, then use your usual
Kafka admin tooling to see the message arrive in your topic.
