# How to build in security as a SaaS feature

In this post I'm going to show you how to provide more granular and more
secure connectivity to and from a SaaS platform. The end result is a holistic
solution that looks and feels like a natural extension of the SaaS platform, 
and is either offered as a feature for enterprise focused plans,
or as a competitive differentiator to all your customers. The total time
required to run the demo is just a few minutes. I'll also dig deep into 
what's happening behind the scenes to explain how the magic works.

First, let me give some background on why this specific need arises and 
highlight the shortcomings in traditional implementations. Because those old 
approaches don't work any more.

> You need to start thinking of security as a 
feature. If you're a VP of engineering, if you're a product manager, product 
owner, give time to security, let your developers create a better, more secure 
infrastructure.<br/>
> &mdash; [Joel Spolsky](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/api-finance-mesh/), Founder of Stack Overflow


The most successful products over the coming decade will be the ones that 
realise the status-quo approaches are no longer good enough. You don't need
to take Joel's word for it either, take a read of the details of the recently
announced [Private Cloud Compute](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/)
from Apple. One of the most successful companies over the past two decades 
is making a clear statement that security, privacy, and trust will be a core
differentiator. They even discuss how current usage of protocols like TLS can't
provide the end-to-end security and privacy guarantees customers should expect.

I worked on connecting systems to each other many years ago, a labor-intensive 
task in the earliest stages of my career. Our company was growing and we'd patch 
the server room in the current building to the system we just installed in the 
new building. The new office was a few blocks down the street and we were 
working with the local telco to install a dedicated line. At the time, 
connecting two separate networks had an obvious and physically tangible reality 
to it.

We all moved on from those days. Now, modern tech stacks are more complicated; a 
series of interconnected apps spread across the globe, 
run in the cloud by 'best of breed' product companies. Over decades, we evolved. 
Today it's rare that two separate companies 
actually want to connect their entire networks to each other&mdash;it's specific 
apps and workloads within each network that need to communicate. Yet we've
continued to use old approaches as the way to "securely" connect our 
systems. The actual running of cables has been abstracted away but we're virtually
doing the same thing. These old approaches expose you transitively to an uncountable number 
of networks, which is an enormous attack surface ripe for exploitation.

## The need to connect to a private system

What people mean when they say "cloud" or "on-prem" has become blurred over 
the previous decades. To avoid any confusion I'll create a hypothetical
scenario for us:

* **Initech Platform:** This is a SaaS platform that you operate. It's elastic
and scaleable and hosted on one of the major cloud providers. Customers buy
the platform to improve their DevOps processes as it provides visibility over
a bunch of useful metrics and provides useful feedback directly into their development
workflows. 
* **ACME Corp:** This is a large customer of Initech that you want to support. 
They run a lot of 
infrastructure in various locations. Is it "on-prem" in the classic sense of
being inside their own data center? Is it inside their own VPC on one of the 
major cloud providers? It doesn't matter! Customer systems are running in one or 
more networks that Initech doesn't control, that we don't have access to, and that
aren't directly accessible from the public internet. 

### Proactive engagement in developer workflows

In building the early version of the Initech Platform there's a lot
of potential customers to work with to prove product-market fit. It will
integrate with the public APIs of the major version control system providers 
(For example GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), use the commit/webhooks to react to events, 
push results into the workflow, and everything works as expected. 

This is great 
while the product is passive and simply reacts to events initiated by someone at 
ACME Corp. Many services want to provide value by assessing external changes in the world, 
and being proactive in driving improvements for their customers. 

Think of the many dependency or security scanning services&mdash;if there's a new
vulnerability disclosure they want to create a pull/merge request on all impacted
repositories as quickly as possible. The fully managed VCS services with public APIs
provide ways to enable this, however the self-hosted versions of these products
don't have a publicly accessible API. The customers that opt to self-host these
systems typically skew towards large enterprises, so now we're faced with some
difficult decisions: Is Initech unable to sell their product to these high value 
customers? Do customers have to buy a diminshed version of the product that's 
missing one of the most valuable features? Or do we ask them
to re-assess some aspect of their security & networking posture to give Initech access?

### Access to private data

Initech needs to query a database to display their 
custom reporting solution. This isn't a problem that's unique to Initech as almost
every Customer Data Platform (CDP) or visualization tool has the same problem:
customers don't want to make their private data accessible from the
public internet, so it will typically be in a database in a private subnet. 

## The problems with our current approaches

As I said earlier, modern tech stacks have evolved to a series of interconnected apps.
However the way we connect these apps has changed only a little from the way we connected
networks decades ago. While these approaches are convenient and familiar, they 
were never designed for the use cases we have today. They're instead attempts 
to make the smallest tweaks possible to the way things used to work to 
try and get close to how we need things to work today.

### Putting systems on the public internet

The default deployment option for most private systems is to locate them in
a private network, with a private subnet, with no public IP addresses. There
are very good reasons for this! The easiest option for Initech to connect to this
private system would
be to ask ACME Corp to provide a public IP address or hostname
that could be accessible from the internet.

This is bad.

All of the good reasons for initially putting a system in a private network
disconnected from the world immediately vanish. This system is now reachable
by the entire public internet, allowing thousands of would-be hackers to 
constantly try and brute-force their way into the system or to simply DoS it.
You're a single leaked credential, CVE, or other issue away from getting owned.

![Accessible from the public internet](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/public-internet.png)

### Reverse proxies

Another approach is to put a reverse proxy in front of the system. I'm not just
talking something like nginx and HA Proxy, there's a whole category of hosted or
managed services that fit this description too.

This has the advantage that ACME Corp is no longer putting a private system 
directly on the public internet. The reverse proxy also adds the 
ability to rate-limit or fine-tune access restrictions to mitigate potential DoS
attacks. This is a defense in depth improvement, but ACME Corp is still allowing
the entire public internet to reach and attempt to attack the proxy. If it's
compromised, it'll do what a proxy does: let traffic through to the intended
destination.

![Reverse Proxies](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/reverse-proxy.png)

### IP allow lists

An incremental improvement is for Initech to provide a list of IPs they will be
sending requests from, and have ACME Corp manage their firewall and routing 
rules to allow requests only from those IP addresses. This isn't much of an
improvement though.

![IP Allow Lists](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/ip-allow-list.png)

At Initech you won't want to have a tight coupling to your current app instances 
and the IP addresses, you'll want the flexibility to be able to scale 
infrastructure as required without the need to constantly inform 
customers of new IP addresses. So the IP addresses will most likely belong to
a NAT gateway or proxy server. ACME Corp might assume that locking access down
to only one or two source IP addresses means that only one or two remote machines
have access to their network. The reality is that anything on the remote 
network that can send a request through the NAT gateway or proxy will now be
granted access into the ACME Corp network too. This isn't allowing a single
app or machine in, you've permitted an entire remote network.

Even more concerning though is that IP source addresses are [trivially spoofed](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/curl-test-ip-spoofing).
A potential attacker would be able to create a well formed request, spoof the
source address, and send data or instructions into the ACME Corp network. SaaS
vendors, Initech included, also inevitably have to document the list of current
IP addresses so there's a ready-made list of IPs to try and impersonate.

The more sophisticated your approach to IP filtering the more sophisticated an attacker needs to 
be to compromise it, but none of them are perfect. I've heard people claim in 
the past that IP spoofing is only really for DDoS attacks because in most cases 
the attacker can't receive the response and so they can't do anything useful. 
Think about the systems we're connecting - how confident are you that there are 
zero fire and forget API calls that won't dutifully create/update/destroy valuable 
data? Good security is more than just preventing the exposure of data, it's also 
about protecting it and guaranteeing its integrity. 

If you're a valuable target, such as a major financial instition, attackers have 
the motivation to use approaches like this to [launch MitM attacks & intercept comms flows](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/ip-spoofing).
If your customers and prospects and valuable targets, that makes you a valuable 
target too.

### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

VPNs are a common solution at many companies to allow employees to 
connect to the "corporate network" when they're outside of the office. They are
also used to allow other systems to connect to an existing network.

The use case we're talking about here is different. It's about allowing two 
separate companies, a SaaS product and their 
customer(s), being able to communicate with each other. In many of those cases 
it's only _one_ system at each end of the connection that should be able to talk to 
each other. Instead we reach for a tool that is designed to connect entire 
networks. It's like running a virtual patch lead from the router in one company 
to the router in another. If I asked you to do the physical version of that, 
to plug a cable from your production environment directly into the production environment of 
another company, you'd probably give it some pause. A lot of pause. And for good 
reason. But VPNs are "virtual" and "private" and so easy (relative to running a 
cable) and so ubiquitous we don't give it as much thought. If all you needed 
to do was connect one thing in each network you've used a very blunt instrument 
for what was meant to be a very precise task.

You can still do the precise task using a VPN, but there are layers of network-level
controls and routing rules you need to ensure are in place to close down all 
the doors to just the one you want open in each network. It's another example of 
how we've got tools and approaches that are great at what they were designed for, 
but we're making incremental steps in how we use them to force them to work with 
our evolved needs. Doing that securely means layering in more complexity and 
hoping the we get all of the detail in all of those layers right, all of the time.
Getting it wrong carries risks of transitive
access beyond the original intentions.

The problem with each of these approaches is that to assume it's 
secure requires many additional assumptions: that nobody on the internet will try to
compromise you, that you can trust the source IP of the requests, that the 
remote network is solely composed of good actors, that these assumptions will 
continue to be true both now and indefinitely into the future&hellip; 
**and that all of these assumptions are also true of every network you've
connected to, and any network they've connected to, and any network&hellip;**

Take a look at what this might look like from ACME Corp's perspective:

![image](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/highly-connected-customer.png)

It's not _just_ two networks and two companies now connected to each other, it's
many networks. Each SaaS vendor will have their own set of services they use
which multiplies this out further. Not only can you not trust the network, you
can't trust anybody else's either. Any participant in this picture is only a
network misconfiguration or compromised dependency away from transmitting that
risk through the network(s). And this picture is the most zoomed in example of 
a fractal of this problem! Zoom out, and each vendor is connected to their own
set of customers, with their own vendors, with their own customers... the
risk surface area grows exponentionally.

## So let's solve it!

![Connection via an agent](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/agent.png)

We can build security as a feature into our product within minutes! We'll
raise the security bar by providing a more focussed and granular solution. 
We're also going to stop pushing the problems onto 
customer's like ACME Corp by asking them to make network-level changes. Instead
we're going to shift secure connectivity up to an application-level concern, and 
provide a holistic product experience by extending the Initech Platform into 
the specific places it needs to me. 

The example here is going to walk through how Initech Platform can establish 
a connection to a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise server that's managed by ACME
Corp. The final result will look like:

![Final secure connected product](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/secure-example-final.png)

### Step 1 - Setup a new project

On an admin's work machine, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
    https://install.command.ockam.io \
    | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
ockam enroll
ockam project ticket --expires-in 24h --usage-count 1 \
    --attribute outlet-to-saas --attribute inlet-from-saas \
    --relay saas-relay \
    --enroller \
    > saas.ticket
```

If you've not used Ockam before this will take less that a minute to complete
(if you're an existing user it will be even quicker!),
at the end you'll have a new Ockam account and project, as well as an enrollment
ticket your can use to admit the first system into your project.

Let's go through these commands in detail to explain everything that's
happening.

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop: '5rem', marginBottom: '5rem'}}>

#### Install Ockam

This will install the `ockam` command and source in the required environment 
settings. If you've previously installed `ockam` you can skip this step.

```bash focus=1:3
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
    https://install.command.ockam.io \
    | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
ockam enroll
ockam project ticket --expires-in 24h --usage-count 1 \
    --attribute outlet-to-saas --attribute inlet-from-saas \
    --relay saas-relay \
    --enroller \
    > saas.ticket
```

---

#### Enroll 

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command is a number of steps that will 
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:
- Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
- Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
- Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
- Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

```bash focus=4
```

---

#### Generate a ticket for Initech Platform

The next step is to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to
join the project that was just created. This node will run adjacent to the
Initech Platform SaaS, in the network where the SaaS service is running.

In this example we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage 
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket can only be used a single time,
and that it must be used within 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is
low risk associated with this ticket being mishandled after use, there's no
means for an attacker to re-use it like a credential to access any system. 
Similarly the expiry time could be significantly reduced to only a few minutes
to ensure only the intended party has the chance to use it.

```bash focus=5
```

---

#### Setting custom attributes

The Project Membership Credential that is issued will include additional 
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's 
Membership Authority. These attributes can then be used to apply policies with 
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specfic actions and 
communucation paths between nodes.

In this example the attributes being set are `outlet-to-saas`
and `inlet-from-saas`.

```bash focus=6
```

---
#### Permission to create a relay

The `--relay "saas-relay"` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows
this node to create a relay at the address `saas-relay`. 

```bash focus=7
```

---

#### Setting the enroller role

While creating the ticket we are also adding additional attributes that will
be applied to any node that enrolls with this ticket. 

The `ockam-role` attribute is a special attribute, and the value of `enroller` 
means this node will be granted permission to generate tickets to enroll new 
members into the project in the future.

The output of this `ockam project ticket` command will generate an enrollment
ticket, which is then piped to a file named `saas.ticket`.

```bash focus=8:9
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

### Step 2 - Enroll the Initech Platform

Move the `saas.ticket` (from the previous step) to a machine on the same network 
as the Initech Platform. We're going to create a reusable configuration file
named `saas.yaml` that we'll use to setup our Ockam node that will run on the
SaaS platform:

```yaml saas.yaml
relay: saas-relay

tcp-outlet:
  from: saas
  to: http-server:80
  allow: inlet-to-saas

policy:
  resource-type: tcp-inlet
  allow: outlet-from-saas
``` 

Replace the `http-server` value with the hostname or IP address that resolves
to the Initech Platform from within the Initech network. Then run:

```bash
ockam node create saas.yaml --enrollment-ticket saas.ticket
ockam project ticket --expires-in 24h --usage-count 1 \
    --attribute inlet-to-saas --attribute outlet-from-saas \
    --relay acme-relay > acme.ticket
```

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop:'5rem', marginBottom:'5rem'}}>

#### Create a node, relay, and policies

An Ockam Node is a program that can interact with other Ockam Nodes using 
various Ockam protocols like Ockam Routing and Ockam Secure Channels.

Here you can see that when we call the `ockam node create` command we're providing 
the configuration YAML from above, along with the enrollment ticket we created in the
first step. For
now all we need to understand is that this single command creates and starts a 
node, enrolls it into our project, sets up a relay so that nodes on other
networks can route to it, and adds attribute based access controls (ABAC) to
restrict which other nodes can establish a route.

```bash focus=1
ockam node create saas.yaml --enrollment-ticket saas.ticket
ockam project ticket --expires-in 24h --usage-count 1 \
    --attribute inlet-to-saas --attribute outlet-from-saas \
    --relay acme-relay > acme.ticket
```

---

#### Generate a ticket for ACME Corp

Because we granted this node the role of `enroller`, we can now use it to
generate enrollment tickets for other nodes. In this step we generate a ticket
to give to our customer, ACME Corp.

Once again we set the ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and specify a usage 
count of `1`. We also add the custom attributes of `inlet-to-saas` and `outlet-from-saas`
which we'll use in our policies to restrict access to our services, we specify
that the node that enrolls with this ticket has permission to create a relay 
named `acme-relay`, and finally we pipe the result to a file name `acme.ticket`.

```bash focus=2:4
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop:'5rem', marginBottom:'5rem'}}>

#### Create a node & relay

The `saas.yaml` configuration file passed into the  `ockam node create` command 
defines a number of properties on this node. So let's walk through all of things
it sets up for us.

After creating the node a relay is created with the name `saas-relay`. 
This relay will allow customers of the Initech Platform, such as ACME Corp,
to establish a secure end-to-end encrypted connection _in_ to the platform. 
It provides the ability to have entirely isolated
infrastructure running within a private network, without requiring 
Initech to expose any endpoints or post to the public Internet.

```yaml focus=1
relay: saas-relay

tcp-outlet:
  from: saas
  to: http-server:80
  allow: inlet-to-saas

policy:
  resource-type: tcp-inlet
  allow: outlet-from-saas
```

---

#### Create an outlet

A TCP outlet takes any TCP packets received by the node, and pipes them out to
the specified location. 

In this example we're giving the TCP outlet the name `saas`, and forwarding packets 
it receives to the `http-server:80` address.

```yaml focus=3:5
```
---

#### Restrict access with policies

An Ockam TCP inlet defines where a node should be listening for connections, and 
where it should forward that traffic to. We'll create an inlet on this node in 
the Initech Network later, which will allow us to connect to the outlet that will run in 
the customer network. 

Before we do that though, we can define a policy to restrict what exactly the
inlet is allowed to connect to.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to only allow TCP
inlets to be created to other nodes that have the attribute `outlet-from-saas`
as part of their attested credentials (which is part of the `acme.ticket` 
we created earlier). 

```yaml focus=8:10
```

---

We've also used the shorthand policy form in the configuration file to specify
that only nodes with an attribute of `inlet-to-saas` are permitted to establish
a route to this node.

```yaml focus=6
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

So far we've setup the highlighted parts of our infrastructure:

![Initial secure platform node](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/secure-example-platform-step.png)

### Step 3 - ACME Corp connects to Initech

Move `acme.ticket` (from the previous step) to a machine in ACME Corp's 
environment, and create the following `customer.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml customer.yaml
relay: $RELAY

tcp-inlet:
  from: 0.0.0.0:7000
  via: saas-relay
  to: saas
  allow: outlet-to-saas

tcp-outlet:
  from: github
  to: $GITHUB_ADDRESS
  allow: inlet-from-saas

policy:
  resource-type: tcp-outlet
  allow: inlet-from-saas
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
ockam node create customer.yaml \
    --enrollment-ticket acme.ticket \
    --variable RELAY=acme-relay \
    --variable GITHUB_ADDRESS=github.local:80
```

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop:'5rem',marginBottom:'5rem'}}>

#### Create the customer node

You've seen most of this command before: The customer would run `ockam node create`
within the ACME Corp network, pass in the `customer.yaml` configuration file and
the `acme.ticket` enrollment ticket we generated earlier. 

What is new here is the use of the `--variable` flag. This allows us to specify
variables that will be interpolated into the `customer.yaml` file. In a scenario
like this one it means we could have a generic `customer.yaml` file that is 
able to be used by all customers, with any customer-specific values passed in
at runtime as variables.

```bash focus=3:4
ockam node create customer.yaml \
    --enrollment-ticket acme.ticket \
    --variable RELAY=acme-relay \
    --variable GITHUB_ADDRESS=github.local:80
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop:'5rem',marginBottom:'5rem'}}>

#### Create the customer node, relay, inlet, and outlet

After creating the node ACME Corp within the ACME Corp network, a relay is 
created using the value of the `RELAY` variable (i.e., `acme-relay`). This
relay is what allows the Initech Platform to create a portal into to the
required service within the ACME Corp network &mdash; without requiring ACME
Corp to expose listening ports to the Internet!

```yaml focus=1
relay: $RELAY

tcp-inlet:
  from: 0.0.0.0:7000
  via: saas-relay
  to: saas
  allow: outlet-to-saas

tcp-outlet:
  from: github
  to: $GITHUB_ADDRESS
  allow: inlet-from-saas

policy:
  resource-type: tcp-outlet
  allow: inlet-from-saas
```

---

#### Create an inlet

A TCP inlet is created, listening on `0.0.0.0:7000`. All requests to that 
address will be forwarded to `saas-relay` relay that was created previously,
and then on to the TCP outlet named `saas`.

This inlet allows ACME Corp to have a private end-to-end connection directly
from their network to the Initech Platform, without the need to communicate 
directly with a publicly addressable interface on the Initech side. So far, this
configuration has only enabled communication to be initiated from the
ACME Corp side.

```yaml focus=3:7
```

---

#### Create an outlet

The final step on the ACME Corp side is to create the TCP outlet that will
forward packets to the intended destination. 

The TCP outlet created here is given an outlet name of `github`. This provides 
flexibility for adding additional destinations later without the need to create 
new enrollment tickets, nodes, relays, etc.

The destination for all packets coming through this outlet address will be sent
to the value of the `GITHUB_ADDRESS` variable, which for this example we're 
assuming is the location of the GitHub Enterprise server at `github.local` on
port `80`.

```yaml focus=9:11
```

---

#### Restrict access with policies

One last bit of polish is to ensure that outlets can only be accessed by nodes
that have the `inlet-from-saas` attribute set. We set this rule with the 
shorthand notation explicitly on the TCP outlet we've defined, in addition to 
setting a default policy for any future TCP outlets that might be created.

If you scroll back up to the very start you'll see that the only enrollment ticket
with the `inlet-from-saas` attribute was the very first one we created for the
Initech Platform. This means the only node that will be permitted to access
the TCP outlets at ACME Corp is the node running on the Initech Platform.

```yaml focus=12:16
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

<CH.Scrollycoding style={{marginTop:'5rem',marginBottom:'5rem'}}>

#### Optional - create more outlets

In this example we've used the `customer.yaml` configuration file to create 
a TCP outlet that will connect to ACME Corp's self-hosted GitHub enterprise 
server. That works great if you know every customer of Initech is wanting to 
expose a GitHub server. 

If you need an approach with more flexibility an alternative is to create the
outlets as required via the Ockam Command CLI. Remove the `tcp-outlet` section
from `customer.yaml` and instead pass the same parameters directly into 
`ockam tcp-outlet create`.

```bash focus=1
ockam tcp-outlet create --from github --to github.local:80
ockam tcp-outlet create --from jira --to jira.local:443
ockam tcp-outlet create --from database --to analytics.prod:5432
```

---

Now if some customers require additional outlets you can create a new outlet
that forwards packets to a different destination. These examples show how 
you'd create an outlet named `jira` and `database` and have each go to a 
different destination.

```bash focus=2:3
```

---

What's great about this is that we're able to re-use the same Ockam Node and 
Relay to make this work. The Initech Platform will be able to create a TCP inlet
that can access these services by specifying the name of the outlet it wants 
to connect to.

```bash focus=1:3
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

Our secure and private connectivity between ACME Corp and the Initech Platform
is almost complete:

![Initial secure platform node](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/secure-example-customer-step.png)


### Step 4 - Initech connects to ACME Corp (as required)

In the Initech Platform application's environment, run:

```bash
ockam tcp-inlet create --from 0.0.0.0:8000 --via acme-relay --to github
```

This call to `ockam tcp-inlet create` will:

* Create a TCP inlet that is listening on `0.0.0.0:8000`
* Forward packets to the `acme-relay` relay created by ACME Corp
* Targeting the `github` address on the TCP outlet at the other end

The result of this is that requests from the Initech Platform to `0.0.0.0:8000`
will resolve to the private GitHub Enterprise server running inside the
ACME Corp network.

We've now added the final piece to our architecture diagram:

![Private and secure connection to GitHub Enterprise self-hosted](/blog/building-secure-saas-platforms/secure-example-platform-final-step.png)

This connection does not need to be long-lived either, and can be created
on-demand only when the Initech Platform requires access to the ACME Corp 
GitHub server. To access the Jira and database outlets (from the optional outlets
earlier) it's as simple as running:

```bash
ockam tcp-inlet create --from 0.0.0.0:6000 --via acme-relay --to jira
ockam tcp-inlet create --from 0.0.0.0:9000 --via acme-relay --to database
```

The Jira and database sytems will now be available to the Initech Platform at
`localhost` on ports `6000` and `9000` respectively.

## Wrapping it up

There's a lot of detail here explaining _how_ all of this works, in reality it 
takes only minutes to implement and run each step. Within those few minutes we've been able to:

* Establish an Ockam Portal between two applications in two separate networks. 
* See how a customer can quickly create a private path to a service without the 
need to make network or infrastructure changes.
* Allow a SaaS platform to provide a completely private connection to their own service.

For the SaaS platforms there's only a small step required to wrap the customer-facing
command and config into a single script or binary wrapper. That could then be used 
as the initial basis for a broker or agent-like experience products like Snyk or 
Buildkite already provide 
(for example, just rename the wrapper script to `initech-agent`! 😉).
