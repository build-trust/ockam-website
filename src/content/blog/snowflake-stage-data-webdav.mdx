Wouldn't it be nice to access files in a Snowflake stage, using HTTP requests, as if they were locally mounted on your machine?
Wouldn't it be even better if it was not necessary to manage IP allow lists, open firewall ports, or setup services like PrivateLink? 
Would you believe me if I told you that it would take you less than 15 minutes to setup?

Introducing the Snowflake Stage Data with WebDAV Connector!

## Snowflake ðŸ’™ WebDAV

WebDAV, is a protocol for authoring and exchanging documents, based on the HTTP protocol.

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions.

One way to import data into Snowflake is to use the [`snow` command line client](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/installation/installation) 
or the [`snowflake-connector-python` Python library](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-install) to upload files and 
have them be mapped to tables for later processing. Unfortunately, both those tools require a specific installation, and an OAuth authentication,
whereas HTTP commands can be easily executed with an ubiquitous utility like `curl`.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely access a Snowflake stage in your account, with WebDAV, in just a few minutes. 
We will:

* Create a stage associated to your Snowflake account.
* Create a WebDAV server on Snowflake with a private encrypted connection.
* Upload, list, download and remove files with WebDAV commands.


![Snowflake stage data with WebDAV](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-stage-data-webdav.png)


## Create a stage

This can be done with just a few commands in the Snowsight editor:
```sql
-- create a test database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS WEBDAV_TEST_DATABASE;
USE DATABASE WEBDAV_TEST_DATABASE;

-- create a test schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS WEBDAV_TEST_SCHEMA;
USE SCHEMA WEBDAV_TEST_SCHEMA;

-- create an internal stage
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS SECURE ENCRYPTION = (type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
```

The files contained in that stage can be listed with:
```sql
LIST @"SECURE";
```

And the stage should be empty for now!

## Setup a WebDAV server inside Snowflake

We are now going to create a WebDAV server for the previous stage inside Snowflake.
This will create a point-to-point connection between the two systems &mdash; without the need to expose
any systems to the public internet!

### !!steps Get the app

The Snowflake stage data with WebDAV Connector by Ockam is [available in the Snowflake Marketplace - FIXME](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/TODO).

![!tour Get the app - FIXME](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/app-store.png)

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse to utilize to activate the app and can choose to change the application name.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool.

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/launch-app.png)

</ImageTour>

## Configuration

We are now going to configure the application. We first need to:

 - Create an Ockam project and issue an enrollment ticket
 - Configure the user name and password which will be used to access the server.


<CodeTour>

### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash ! tour
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.


### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash ! tour
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will run alongside
the WebDAV started by the "Stage data with WebDAV - Connector" application, and provide one of the ends of our point-to-point connection.

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to
join the project that was just created. This node will run alongside the WebDAV server, inside your Snowflake account:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute webdav \
  --relay webdav > webdav.ticket
```

### !!steps

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means
for an attacker to re-use it like an API token to access any system.

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute webdav \
  --relay webdav > webdav.ticket
```

### !!steps

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `webdav`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute webdav \
  --relay webdav > webdav.ticket
```

### !!steps

The `--relay webdav` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows this
node to create a relay at the address `webdav`.

This relay will allow a WebDAV client to establish a secure end-to-end
encrypted connection to the WebDAV server, running in your Snowflake account, without requiring you to expose any
endpoints to the public Internet.

As the final part of this command we pipe the generated ticket to a file named `webdav.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute webdav \
# !focus(1:1)
  --relay webdav > webdav.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

## Configuring the application

<ImageTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Click "Get started" to open the Snowflake setup screen.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-get-started-app.png)

Take the contents of the file `webdav.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-ticket.png)

### !!steps Configure the stage access

In this screen, we need to enter:

 - The full name of the stage we want to access: `WEBDAV_TEST_DATABASE.WEBDAV_TEST_SCHEMA.SECURE`.

![!tour Configure the stage access](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-configure-stage-access.png)

### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow
outbound connections to your Ockam project.

Toggle the `Grant access to egress and reach your Project` button and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`.

Toggle the `Grant access to your user` button, enter `user` for the user name and `password` for the user password.

![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-grant-privileges.png)


### !!steps Start the WebDAV server

Press "Next" and wait for the WebDAV server to start. Once started, you should be able to see the WebDAV server logs.

![!tour Start server](/blog/snowflake-stage-data-webdav/snowflake-start-server.png)

You can also notice a tab containing the logs for an Ockam node. That Ockam node is a portal outlet which:

  - Created a relay named `webdav` in the Ockam project.
  - Declares that only clients with the attribute `webdav-client` can access the relay.

</ImageTour>

## Connect the WebDAV client

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Generate an enrollment ticket for the WebDAV client

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the WebDAV server.
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run on our local machine:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute webdav-client > webdav-client.ticket
```

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute webdav-client > webdav-client.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attested attribute of `webdav-client`, corresponding to the attribute expected by 
the Ockam outlet node started in your Snowflake account.

The ticket is then saved to a file called `webdav-client.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute webdav-client > webdav-client.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

<CodeTour> 

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're now going to pass the configuration for our local Ockam Node as a JSON file, so
save the configuration to the right into a file named `webdav.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "from": "0.0.0.0:8001",
    "via": "webdav",
    "allow": "webdav"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, instructing the node
to create a portal inlet. An inlet receives message sent to the local `from` address, encrypts them and 
forwards them to the project relay named `webdav`.

```javascript ! tour
{
// !focus(1:1)
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "from": "0.0.0.0:8001",
    "via": "webdav",
    "allow": "webdav"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We also define a policy to restrict which are nodes that are expected to be connected to our inlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow
other nodes that have the attribute `webdav` as part of their attested
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `webdav` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "from": "0.0.0.0:8001",
    "via": "webdav",
// !focus(1:1)      
    "allow": "webdav"
  }
}
```

### !!steps Start the Ockam inlet node

We can now finally start the Ockam inlet node with this command

```shell ! tour
ockam node create --configuration webdav.json --enrollment-ticket webdav-client.ticket
```

</CodeTour> 

## Testing the connection

<CodeTour> 
We are now ready to access our Snowflake stage, with WebDAV, via a fully secure point-to-point connection!

### !!steps Create a file

Before connecting we create a file which will be uploaded to Snowflake

```shell ! tour
echo "Hello Snowflake!" > hello.txt
```

### !!steps Upload a file

The `hello.txt` file can now be uploaded with a simple `curl` command
```shell ! tour
curl -T test/hello.txt -u user:password http://localhost:8001
```

### !!steps List files on the Snowflake stage

We can check that the file has indeed be uploaded by listing the stage contents from inside Snowsight
```sql ! tour
LIST @"SECURE";
```

### !!steps List remote files

We can also list the contents of the stage with another `curl` command, using the WebDAV `PROPFIND` method
```shell ! tour
curl -X PROPFIND \
  -u user:password http://localhost:8001/ \
  -H "Depth: 1"
```

### !!steps Download a file

We can download that same file from the stage

```shell ! tour
curl -u user:password \
  -O http://localhost:8001/hello.txt
```

### !!steps Delete a file

And finally we can remove the file from the stage

```shell ! tour
curl -X DELETE \
  -u user:password http://localhost:8001/hello.txt
```

</CodeTour> 


## Next steps

In summary, we are now able to securely access the contents of a Snowflake private stage, without exposing any port to the
internet, with a few simple WebDAV commands.
