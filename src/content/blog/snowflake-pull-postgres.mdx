What if I told you there was a way to use Change Data Capture (CDC) to stream all
those insights you've got in your private PostgreSQL Database, in real-time, back to Snowflake? That it'll
use private point-to-point connections that don't require you to manage IP
allow lists, open firewall ports, or setup services like PrivateLink, and that it
will take you less than 15 minutes to setup!

Introducing the Snowflake Pull to PostgreSQL Connector!

## Snowflake ðŸ’™ PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system that's widely 
used for storing and managing structured data. It's often the backbone of many 
applications, holding critical operational data. However, getting this data into 
a centralized analytics platform can be challenging.

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions. 

Connecting to your PostgreSQL database can be problematic depending on your network 
topology. It would be convenient to give the database a public address, but that's a 
significant increase in risk for a system that handles a lot of important data. 
Managing IP allow lists and updating firewall ingress rules improves security 
but can be cumbersome to manage. Alternatives like PrivateLink are better, but 
they too can be cumbersome to setup and require your systems to be on the same 
public cloud and in the same region.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely connect Snowflake to your 
private PostgreSQL database, in just a few minutes. We will:

* Setup a PostgreSQL database in AWS with CDC enabled
* Connect PostgreSQL to Snowflake with a private encrypted connection
* Configure Snowflake to receive and store the data from PostgreSQL

## Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL

We're going to provision an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Database so we can see an end-to-end 
experience of data moving from Snowflake to PostgreSQL. If you have an existing 
PostgreSQL database you're able to use you can skip this step.

### Create a PostgreSQL database

<ImageTour>

### !!steps

Within your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) search for 
`RDS` in the search field at the top and select the matching result. Visit the 
`Databases` screen, and then click `Create Database`.

The `Standard Create` option provides a good set of defaults for creating a
RDS Database, so unless you've previous knowledge or experience to know you
might want something different I'd suggest choosing "PostgreSQL" and confirming the details and 
then clicking `Create database` at the bottom of the screen.

Once you've started the database creation it may take about 15 minutes for
provisioning to complete and for your database to be available.

</ImageTour>

### Enable CDC on PostgreSQL

To enable Change Data Capture (CDC) on your PostgreSQL database, you'll need to 
modify some configuration parameters. In the RDS console:

1. Go to the "Configuration" tab of your RDS instance
2. Click on the parameter group linked to your instance
3. Modify the following parameters:
   - Set `rds.logical_replication` to 1
4. Save changes and reboot your RDS instance

### Create a table

Create a table in your PostgreSQL database to store the data that will be replicated to Snowflake. In addition, you may also need to set the replica identity to FULL for the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.customers
(
    id                  INTEGER,
    customer_name       VARCHAR
);

ALTER TABLE customers REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

## Connect PostgreSQL to Snowflake

We've created a PostgreSQL database with CDC enabled. It's now time to connect it 
to Snowflake! The next stage is going to complete the picture below, creating a 
point-to-point connection between the two systems &mdash; without the need to expose 
any systems to the public internet!

### !!steps Get the app

The Snowflake Pull from PostgreSQL Connector by Ockam is [available in the Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTYZXRGOHF/ockam-pull-from-postgresql-connector).

![!tour Get the app](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/app-store.png)

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse to utilize to activate the app and can choose to change the application name.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool. 

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the 
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need 
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/launch-app.png)

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>
### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash ! tour
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment 
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.


### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash ! tour
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will 
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for PostgreSQL

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will run alongside
our PostgreSQL database, and provide one of the ends of our point-to-point connection.

![Amazon RDS PostgreSQL setup screen](/blog/snowflake-push-postgres/aws-rds-setup.png)

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to 
join the project that was just created. This node will run alongside the 
Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Database, in the network where the Amazon RDS is running:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute postgres \
  --relay postgres > postgres.ticket
```

### !!steps 

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage 
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and 
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low 
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means 
for an attacker to re-use it like an API token to access any system. 

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute postgres \
  --relay postgres > postgres.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's 
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with 
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and 
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `postgres`. 

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute postgres \
  --relay postgres > postgres.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The `--relay postgres` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows this 
node to create a relay at the address `postgres`. 

This relay will allow your Snowflake warehouse to establish a secure end-to-end 
encrypted connection to your PostgreSQL database, without requiring you to expose any 
endpoints to the public Internet.

As the final part of this command we pipe the generated ticket to a file named `postgres.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute postgres \
# !focus(1:1)
  --relay postgres > postgres.ticket
```

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're going to pass the configuration for our Ockam Node as a JSON file, so 
save the configuration to the right into a file named `postgres.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "postgres",
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "$POSTGRES_ENDPOINT:5432",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, with the
first instruction being to create a relay with the name `postgres`. This relay will 
allow Snowflake to establish a secure end-to-end encrypted connection to your
RDS Database. It provides the ability to have entirely isolated infrastructure 
running within a private network, without requiring you to expose any endpoints
to the public Internet and no configuring of allow lists to custom network routes.

```javascript ! tour
{
// !focus(1:1)
  "relay": "postgres",
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "$POSTGRES_ENDPOINT:5432",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

An outlet decrypts any messages received by the node and 
then forwards them to the specified broker address.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "postgres",
// !focus(1:4)  
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "$POSTGRES_ENDPOINT:5432",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

In this example we're giving the interpolated value from the environment
variable `POSTGRES_ENDPOINT`, which we'll set in a later step when we
start the node.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "postgres",
  "tcp-outlet": {
// !focus(1:1)  
    "to": "$POSTGRES_ENDPOINT:5432",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We will setup the PostgreSQL Inlet that runs alongside our Snowflake 
warehouse in a moment. Before we do that though, we can define a policy to restrict what 
nodes can connect to our outlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow 
other nodes that have the attribute `snowflake` as part of their attested 
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `snowflake` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "relay": "postgres",
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "$POSTGRES_ENDPOINT:5432",
// !focus(1:1)      
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps Launch Ockam node for Amazon RDS

The Ockam Node for Amazon RDS is a streamlined way to provision a managed Ockam Node
within your private AWS VPC. 

To deploy the node that will allow Snowflake to reach your Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database visit
the [Ockam Node for Amazon RDS PostgreSQL listing in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zjugwdx5hp2le), and click the `Continue to Subscribe` button, and then
`Continue to Configuration`. 

On the configuration page choose the region that your Amazon RDS cluster is
running in, and then click `Continue to Launch` followed by `Launch`.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon RDS PostgreSQL](/blog/snowflake-push-postgres/aws-marketplace-rds.png)

### !!steps Enter stack details

The initial Create Stack screen pre-fills the fields with the correct
information for your node, so you can press `Next` to proceed.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon RDS - create stack screen](/blog/snowflake-push-postgres/create-stack.png)

### !!steps Enter node configuration

This screen has important details to you need to fill in:

* **Stack name:** Give this stack a recognisable name, you'll see this in 
various locations in the AWS Console. It'll also make it easier to clean these 
resources up later if you wish to remove them.
* **VPC ID:** The ID of the Virtual Private Cloud network to deploy the node in. 
Make sure it's the same VPC where you've deployed your RDS instance.
* **Subnet ID:** Choose same subnet where your RDS instance is deployed.
* **Enrollment ticket:** Copy the contents of the `postgres.ticket` file we 
created earlier and paste it in here.
* **RDS PostgreSQL Database Endpoint:** In the _Connectivity & security_ for 
your Amazon RDS Database you will find Endpoint details. Copy the `Endpoint` 
value for the Private RDS Database that's in the same subnet you chose above.
* **JSON Node Configuration:** Copy the contents of the `postgres.json` file we 
created earlier and paste it in here.

We've now completed the highlighted part of the diagram below, and our Amazon RDS PostgreSQL node is waiting for another node to connect.

### Create a table in Snowflake

Create a table in Snowflake to store the data that will be replicated from PostgreSQL.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER,
    customer_name VARCHAR
);
```

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

![Setting up Ockam Node as native Snowflake app](/blog/snowflake-push-postgres/snowflake-setup.png)

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the Snowflake end. 
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run in our Snowflake warehouse:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set 
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attested attribute of `snowflake`. You'll 
recall in an earlier step we applied a policy to say that nodes in our 
project must have an attribute of `snowflake` to connect to 
the outlet. The node that enrolls with this ticket will also have the
attribute `snowflake`, and so it will be able to communicate with our PostgreSQL 
node. 

The ticket is then saved to a file called `snowflake.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Click "Get started" to open the Snowflake setup screen.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/snowflake-get-started-app.png)

Take the contents of the file `snowflake.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/snowflake-ticket.png)

### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then 
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow 
outbound connections to your Ockam project. 

Toggle the `Grant access to egress and reach your Project` and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`. 

Toggle the `Grant access to your postgre database` and enter the username and password for your 
PostgreSQL database and store it as a secret in snowflake.

Toggle the `Grant access to the tables that will store the replicated data` and select the table(s) that will store the replicated data from Snowflake.

![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/grant-privileges.png)


### !!steps Map Snowflake stream to PostgreSQL table

Snowflake receives each stream of changes to a table in PostgreSQL database, and we need to define the database and mapping between each. Enter the name of the tables in PostgreSQL matching with the tables in Snowflake.

Table with same schema should exist in PostgreSQL database as well as snowflake.

![!tour Map Snowflake tables to PostgreSQL tables](/blog/snowflake-pull-postgres/snowflake-map-tables.png)


</ImageTour>

With that, we've completed the last step in the setup. We've now got a complete
point-to-point connection that allows our Snowflake warehouse to securely
pull data through to our private PostgreSQL database.

![Snowflake push to PostgreSQL setup complete](/blog/snowflake-push-postgres/aws-snowflake-complete.png)

## Next steps

Any updates to your data in your PostgreSQL table will now create a new record in your 
Snowflake table, which are then sent over your Ockam portal.
To see it in action insert a row into your PostgreSQL table, then use your usual
SQL tooling to see the record arrive in your Snowflake table.
