In today's data-driven world, organizations are constantly seeking ways to harness 
the power of real-time data for analytics and decision-making. Apache Kafka has 
emerged as a powerhouse for handling high-volume, real-time data streams, while 
Snowflake offers unparalleled capabilities for data warehousing and analytics. 

What if you could seamlessly combine the strengths of both platforms in less 
than 15 minutes, without the headaches of managing IP allow
lists, opening firewall ports, or navigating the complexities of services like 
PrivateLink?

Today, we're excited to introduce a solution that makes this vision a reality: 
the Pull from Kafka Connector!

## Snowflake ðŸ’™ Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka (and Kafka-compatible alternatives) is the system of choice for building 
flexible, scalable, and reliable streaming platforms to connect data producers and 
consumers. It's often used as the central nervous system for real-time data pipelines 
and streaming applications.

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions. 

Connecting your Kafka broker to Snowflake can be problematic depending on your 
network topology. It would be convenient to give the broker a public address, 
but that's a significant increase in risk for a system that handles a lot of 
important data. Managing IP allow lists and updating firewall ingress rules 
improves security but can be cumbersome to manage. Alternatives like PrivateLink 
are better, but they too can be cumbersome to setup and require your systems to 
be on the same public cloud and in the same region.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely
connect Snowflake to your private Apache Kafka broker, in just a few minutes. We will:

* Setup a managed Kafka cluster in AWS
* Prepare Snowflake to receive data from Kafka
* Connect Snowflake to Kafka with a private encrypted connection - without needing
to expose either system to the public internet!

The final architecture diagram will look like this:

## Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)

We're going to provision an MSK cluster so we can see an end-to-end 
experience of data moving from Snowflake to Kafka. If you have an existing Kafka 
broker you're able to use you can skip this step.

### Create an MSK cluster

<ImageTour>

### !!steps

Within your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) search for 
`MSK` in the search field at the top and select the matching result. Visit the 
`Clusters` screen, and then click `Create Cluster`.

The `Quick Create` option provides a good set of defaults for creating a
Kafka cluster, so unless you've previous knowledge or experience to know you
might want something different I'd suggest just confirming the details and 
then clicking `Create cluster` at the bottom of the screen.

Once you've started the cluster creation it may take about 15 minutes for
provisioning to complete and for your broker to be available.

## Connect Snowflake to Kafka

### Create a table to capture data

Run the code here in a Snowflake worksheet. It will create a new table.

```sql 
CREATE OR REPLACE CUSTOMERS (
  key STRING,
  id INTEGER,
  name STRING,
  email STRING
);

```

We've created a table, Kafka is running. It's now time to connect the two! The
next stage is going to complete the picture below, by creating a point-to-point
connection between the two systems &mdash; without the need to expose any systems
to the public internet!

### !!steps Get the app

The Snowflake Pull from Kafka Connector by Ockam is [invite only](mailto:hello@ockam.io?subject=Invite%20for%20Pull%20from%20Kafka%20Connector),
to get an invite please drop us an email at [hello@ockam.io](mailto:hello@ockam.io?subject=Invite%20for%20Pull%20from%20Kafka%20Connector).
Once invited you'll receive an email with a link to get the app.

![!tour Get the app](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/app-store.png)

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse to utilize to activate the app.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool. 

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the 
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need 
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/launch-app.png)


### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment 
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.


### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will 
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.


### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Kafka

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will run alongside
our Kafka broker, and provide one of the ends of our point-to-point connection.

![Amazon MSK setup screen](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-kafka-setup.png)

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to 
join the project that was just created. This node will run alongside the 
Kafka broker, in the network where the Kafka is running:

```bash
ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 \
  --expires-in 24h --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>

### !!steps 

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage 
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and 
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low 
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means 
for an attacker to re-use it like an API token to access any system. 

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's 
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with 
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and 
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `kafka`. 

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute kafka \
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps 

The `--relay kafka` flag is a shortcut for creating a policy that allows this 
node to create a relay at the address `kafka`. 

This relay will allow your Snowflake warehouse to establish a secure end-to-end 
encrypted connection to your Kafka broker, without requiring you to expose any 
endpoints to the public Internet.

As the final part of this command we pipe the generated ticket to a file named `kafka.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute kafka \
# !focus(1:1)
  --relay kafka > kafka.ticket
```

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're going to pass the configuration for our Ockam Node as a JSON file, so 
save the configuration to the right into a file named `kafka.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "http-server-port": 23345,
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, with the
first instruction being to create a relay with the name `kafka`. This relay will 
allow Snowflake to establish a secure end-to-end encrypted connection to your
Kafka broker. It provides the ability to have entirely isolated infrastructure 
running within a private network, without requiring you to expose any endpoints
to the public Internet and no configuring of allow lists to custom network routes.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "http-server-port": 23345,
// !focus(1:1)
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

An outlet decrypts any messages received by the node and 
then forwards them to the specified broker address.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "http-server-port": 23345,
  "relay": "kafka",
// !focus(1:4)  
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

In this example we're giving the interpolated value from the environment
variable `BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT`, which we'll set in a later step when we
start the node.

```javascript ! tour
{
 "http-server-port": 23345,
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
// !focus(1:1)  
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We will setup the Kafka Inlet that runs alongside our Snowflake 
warehouse in a moment. Before we do that though, we can define a policy to restrict what 
nodes can connect to our outlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow 
other nodes that have the attribute `snowflake` as part of their attested 
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `snowflake` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "http-server-port": 23345,
  "relay": "kafka",
  "kafka-outlet": {
    "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
// !focus(1:1)      
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

</CodeTour>

### !!steps Launch Ockam node for Amazon MSK

The Ockam Node for Amazon MSK is a streamlined way to provision a managed Ockam Node
within your private AWS VPC. 

To deploy the node that will allow Snowflake to reach your Kafka broker visit
the [Ockam Node for Amazon MSK listing in the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iztqd27voc4xg), and click the `Continue to Subscribe` button, and then
`Continue to Configuration`. 

On the configuration page choose the region that your Amazon MSK cluster is
running in, and then click `Continue to Launch` followed by `Launch`.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon MSK](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-marketplace-msk.png)

### !!steps Enter stack details

The initial Create Stack screen pre-fills the fields with the correct
information for your node, so you can press `Next` to proceed.

![!tour Ockam node for Amazon MSK - create stack screen](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/create-stack.png)

### !!steps Enter node configuration

This screen has important details to you need to fill in:

* **Stack name:** Give this stack a recognisable name, you'll see this in various locations in the AWS Console. It'll also make it easier to clean these resources up later if you wish to remove them.
* **VPC ID:** The ID of the Virtual Private Cloud network to deploy the node in. Make sure it's the same VPC where you've deployed your Amazon MSK cluster.
* **Subnet ID:** Choose one of the subnets within your VPC, ensure MSK has a broker address available in that subnet.
* **Enrollment ticket:** Copy the contents of the `kafka.ticket` file we created earlier and paste it in here.
* **Amazon MSK Bootstrap Server with Port:** In the client configuration details for your Amazon MSK cluster you will have a list of bootstrap servers. Copy the `hostname:port` value for the Private endpoint that's in the same subnet you chose above.
* **JSON Node Configuration:** Copy the contents of the `kafka.json` file we created earlier and paste it in here.

We've now completed the highlighted part of the diagram below, and our Kafka
broker node is waiting for another node to connect.

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

![Setting up Ockam Node as native Snowflake app](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-snowflake-setup.png)

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the Snowflake end. 
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run in our Snowflake warehouse:

```bash
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/snowflake-ticket.png)

</ImageTour>

<CodeTour>

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set 
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attested attribute of `snowflake`. You'll 
recall in an earlier step we applied a policy to say that nodes in our 
project must have an attribute of `snowflake` to connect to 
the outlet. The node that enrolls with this ticket will also have the
attribute `snowflake`, and so it will be able to communicate with our Kafka 
node. 

The ticket is then saved to a file called `snowflake.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

</CodeTour>


<ImageTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Take the contents of the file `snowflake.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/snowflake-ticket.png)


### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then 
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow 
outbound connections to your Ockam project. Toggle the 
`Grant access to egress and reach your Project` and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`.

Toggle the `Grant access to the tables where Kafka messages must be inserted` and select the `CUSTOMERS` table.

![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/grant-privileges.png)

### !!steps Map Kafka topics to Snowflake tables

Enter the name of the Kafka topic you want to map to the Snowflake table. In 
this example, the topic is `customers`.

Check "Messages are encoded with a schema" if you have a schema registry and the 
messages are encoded with a schema. The configuration to use to Launch Ockam 
node for Amazon MSK will need to be updated to include the schema registry 
details. Update `$SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` with the address of the schema 
registry. Make sure the ockam node has access to the schema registry.

```bash
{
    "http-server-port": 23345,
    "relay": "kafka",
    "kafka-outlet": {
      "bootstrap-server": "$BOOTSTRAP_SERVER_WITH_PORT",
      "allow": "snowflake"
    },
    "tcp-outlet": {
      "to": "$SCHEMA_REGISTRY_ADDRESS:9081",
      "from": "schema_registry",
      "allow": "snowflake"
    }
  }
  
```
Update other options from default values if needed.


![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-pull-kafka/map-topics.png)


</ImageTour>

With that, we've completed the last step in the setup. We've now got a complete
point-to-point connection that allows our Snowflake warehouse to securely
pull data through to our private Kafka broker.

![Snowflake push to Kafka setup complete](/blog/snowflake-push-kafka/aws-complete.png)

## Next steps

Any updates to your data in your Kafka topic will now create a new row in your Snowflake table.

Post the below message to the Kafka topic to verify the setup.

Replace `$BROKER_ADDRESS` with your actual Kafka broker address, and ensure the topic name (customers in this example) matches the one you've configured in your Snowflake Pull from Kafka Connector setup

```bash
echo '{"key": "customer123", "id": 1001, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}' | \
kafka-console-producer --broker-list $BROKER_ADDRESS:9092 --topic customers
```
The Snowflake connector will then pull these messages from Kafka and insert them into your CUSTOMERS table, mapping the JSON fields to the corresponding columns.
