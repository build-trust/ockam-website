Ockam's Compliance &amp; Audit reports are now publicly available at 
[https://audits.ockam.io/](https://audits.ockam.io/).

As part of our journey towards meeting the various certification standards our customers
expect of us, we've launched a new and permanent home for the collateral people
need to independently verify we are meeting their expectations. 

As we continue to work with our partners and auditors to verify our compliance,
we'll regularly update the Audits homepage to reflect the current status of the
controls we have put in place. If you've any specific questions about any of 
the controls, or you'd like to discuss other compliance needs you don't see 
covered on this page please reach out to us at [security@ockam.io](mailto:security@ockam.io).
