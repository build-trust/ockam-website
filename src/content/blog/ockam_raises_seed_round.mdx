Today we are excited to announce a major milestone in the evolution of Ockam. We closed $4.9 million in seed funding from a group of world class investors: Future Ventures, Core Ventures Group, Okta Ventures, and SGH Capital. These additional resources will accelerate our mission: to enable the builders who are ushering in our shared vision of a seamless connected world.

Since inception we have forged our vision of a seamless, connected world into a simple suite of products that democratize secure IoT development. For far too long, it’s been exceptionally difficult and expensive to build secure connected device systems. These additional resources allow us to grow our high performance team, and to help the builders of IoT systems tackle their complex challenges.

# The Team

Our team philosophy is central to our values at Ockam - so much so that we refer to [“The Team”](https://www.ockam.io/team) as a proper noun. We’re grateful for all the support we’ve received from mentors, advisors, customers, partners, analysts and press. The group of investors participating in this round takes the The Team to the next level.

## Future Ventures

We are thrilled to be working with the amazing team of Maryanna Saenko and Steve Jurvetson of their newly launched [Future Ventures](https://future.ventures/). They have pushed us to think big and far into the future. Moreover they have the technical depth to grasp the complexity of the challenges that face connected device and IoT builders. Maryanna notes, “The security challenges associated with IoT are staggering. In Ockam we recognized a team capable of building a world of connected systems we can actually trust. Their collective knowledge and experience puts them miles ahead in the field." Maryanna has also joined Ockam's Board of Directors.

## Core Ventures Group

We are excited to be working with Joanna Drake, General Partner of Core Ventures Group, who brings hands-on operational expertise to The Team. Core’s focus on founders and their engaged investment model is a great fit for us. Joanna noted, “We are excited to invest in Ockam’s vision. Their approach to solve complex real world problems is a testament to the engineering and industry experience of Matthew Gregory and Mrinal Wadhwa. We are thrilled to be backing such a passionate group of builders.”

## Okta Ventures

We believe the connected device ecosystem will evolve similarly to what happened with open source software and public cloud. No one knows this better than [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). The best way to empower developers is to enable them with tools that allow them to assemble the very best stack for their application.

“Ockam shares our fundamental belief that trust begins with identity, and that integration and partnerships are essential to building trust across the ecosystem. Both Okta and Ockam have a partner-driven ethos, which is apparent in how we build our products, collaborate with partners, and empower the developer ecosystem,” said Monty Gray, SVP, Corporate Development, Okta. "We look forward to partnering with the Ockam Team as they extend identity to IoT and work to secure the devices of the future."

# What’s next for Ockam?

The next few months will be focused on extending our Team capabilities with the most passionate builders who want to join us in our mission to tackle big problems in IoT. To learn more about our plans to scale, please check out our [Team page](/team) .

We hope you’ll join us on our journey.
