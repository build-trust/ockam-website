Ockam's Status page, and historical uptime, is now publicly available at 
[https://status.ockam.io/](https://status.ockam.io/).

The current status of Ockam Orchestrator, our fully managed cloud service, is
now available on our status site. In addition to displaying the current status
of Ockam Orchestrator and its major sub-components, it also provides a
full list of historical incidents and a calculation of uptime over the past 90 days.
