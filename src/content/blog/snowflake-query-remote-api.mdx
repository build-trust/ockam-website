Wouldn't it be nice to be able call a remote API that's only available inside your private network, with a simple Snowflake procedure call?
Wouldn't it be even better if it was not necessary to manage IP allow lists, open firewall ports, or setup services like PrivateLink? 
Would you believe me if I told you that it would take you less than 15 minutes to setup?

Introducing the Snowflake Query Remote API Connector!

## Snowflake ðŸ’™ APIs

Many services offer a HTTP API in addition to a web interface. This makes data retrieval from the command-line very easy, using a 
simple `curl` command.

Snowflake is The Data Cloud and the place to support workloads such as data
warehouses, data lakes, data science / ML / AI, and even cybersecurity. This
centralization brings a huge amount of convenience through breaking down
data silos and allowing teams to make smart data-informed decisions.

You might wonder though how it can be possible to tap into HTTP services from Snowflake applications, if those
services are hosted in private networks. You might also wonder if it is possible to join the results of a remote call
with one of your database tables as if the remote data was available as a local table.

In this post I'm going to show you how to securely access a remote API, hosted in a private network, in just a few minutes. 
We will:

* Install and configure the Query remote API connector.
* Make a stored procedure call to retrieve data as if it was a table select.
* Make a stored procedure call to post data to the API.

## Install and configure the Query Remote API Connector

We are now going to create a set of stored procedures and a portal to access your private API.

<ImageTour>
### !!steps Get the app

The Query Remote API Connector by Ockam is [available in the Snowflake Marketplace - FIXME](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/TODO).

![!tour Get the app](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/app-store.png)

### !!steps Select a warehouse

The first screen you're presented with will ask you to select the warehouse to utilize to activate the app and can choose to change the application name.

![!tour Select a warehouse](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/select-warehouse.png)

### !!steps Grant account privileges

Click the `Grant` button to the right of this screen. The app will then be
automatically granted permissions to create a warehouse and create a compute
pool.

![!tour Grant account privileges](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/grant-account.png)

### !!steps Activate app

Once the permissions grants complete, an `Activate` button will appear. Click
it and the activation process will begin.

![!tour Activate app](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/activate-app.png)

### !!steps Launch app

After the app activates you'll see a page that summarizes the
privileges that the application now has. There's nothing we need
to review or update on these screens yet, so proceed by clicking the `Launch app` button.

![!tour Launch app](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/launch-app.png)

</ImageTour>

## Configuration

We are now going to configure the application. We first need to:

 - Create an Ockam project and issue an enrollment ticket
 - Configure the user name and password which will be used to access the server.


<CodeTour>

### !!steps Download Ockam Command

Run the following command on your local workstation:

```bash ! tour
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL \
  https://install.command.ockam.io \
  | bash && source "$HOME/.ockam/env"
```

This will install the Ockam Command and source in the required environment
settings. If you've installed Ockam Command before you can skip this step.


### !!steps Setup admin account

Once Ockam Command installation is complete you can run:

```bash ! tour
ockam enroll
```

Wrapped up in this single `ockam enroll` command are several steps that will
bootstrap your first project and get you ready to go. It will:

* Generate an Ockam Identity and store its secret keys in a file system based Ockam Vault.
* Create an account with Ockam Orchestrator.
* Provision a trial Space and Project in the Orchestrator.
* Make your Ockam Identity the administrator of your new Project.

### !!steps Generate enrollment ticket for Snowflake

In this section we're going to provision an Ockam node that will allow you to connect to your remote API.

We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow a new Ockam Node to
join the project that was just created. This node will be used by the connector stored procedures to make HTTP calls
from inside your Snowflake account:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

In this command we've set the new ticket to expire in `24 hours`, and a usage
count of `1`. This means the generated ticket is valid for a single use, and
that it's valid for 24 hours. A single usage ticket means there is low
risk associated with mishandling this ticket after use; there's no means
for an attacker to re-use it like an API token to access any system.

```shell ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
  --attribute snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

### !!steps

The Project Membership Credential that's issued will include  
attributes that will be cryptographically attested to by the Project's
Membership Authority. You can use these attributes to apply policies with
Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow or restrict specific actions and
communication paths between nodes.

In this example we assign a single attribute of `snowflake`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 24h \
# !focus(1:1)
  --attribute snowflake \
  --relay snowflake > snowflake.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

## Configuring the application

<ImageTour>

### !!steps Configure connection details

Click "Get started" to open the Snowflake setup screen.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/snowflake-get-started-app.png)

Take the contents of the file `snowflake.ticket` that we just created and paste
it into "Provide the above Enrollment Ticket" form field in the "Configure app"
setup screen in Snowflake.

![!tour Create Snowflake ticket](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/snowflake-ticket.png)

### !!steps Configure API access

In this screen we need to select an authorization method. For this tutorial you 
can select `Digest` and continue. The other options available to use are:

 - `None` No credentials are required to access the remote API.
 - `Basic` The remote API is accessible with a user name and password.
 - `Digest` The remote API is accessible with a user name and password, but they are not transmitted in clear text.
 - `Bearer token` The remote API is accessible with a token passed with an `Authorization` header.
 - `API Key` The remote API is accessible with an API Key passed with a specific extension header (for example `X-api-key`).


![!tour Configure the stage access](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/snowflake-configure-stage-access.png)

### !!steps Grant privileges

To be able to authenticate with Ockam Orchestrator and then
discover the route to our outlet, the Snowflake app needs to allow
outbound connections to your Ockam project.

Toggle the `Grant access to your credentials` button, enter `user` for the user name and `password` for the user password.

Toggle the `Grant access to your Ockam Project` button and approve the connection by
pressing `Connect`.


![!tour Grant egress](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/snowflake-grant-privileges.png)


### !!steps Start the application

Press "Next" and wait for the application to start. Once started, you should be able to see the server logs.

![!tour Start server](/blog/snowflake-query-remote-api/snowflake-start-server.png)

You can also notice a tab containing the logs for an Ockam node. That Ockam node is a portal inlet:

  - Which accesses a relay named `api` in the Ockam project.
  - Declares that only services with the attribute `api` can be connected to the inlet.

</ImageTour>

## Setup an Ockam outlet on the API side

<CodeTour>

### !!steps Generate an enrollment ticket for the Ockam outlet

One end of our connection is now setup, it's time to connect the remote API
We need to generate an enrollment ticket to allow another Ockam Node to
join our project. This node will run in the same network as your remote API:

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute api
  --relay api > api.ticket
```

### !!steps

As we did with the earlier ticket, we've reduced the risk associated with
mishandling a ticket by restricting it's permitted usage window. We've again set
a usage count of `1`, but with a tighter
expiry time of just `2 hours`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
# !focus(1:1)
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute api
  --relay api > api.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential will include an attested attribute of `api`, corresponding to the attribute expected by 
the Ockam inlet node started in your Snowflake account.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  # !focus(1:1)
  --attribute api
  --relay api > api.ticket
```

### !!steps

This credential declares the creation of a relay named `api` to make the service accessible via your Ockam project. 

The ticket is then saved to a file called `api.ticket`.

```bash ! tour
ockam project ticket \
  --usage-count 1 --expires-in 2h \
  --attribute api
  # !focus(1:1)
  --relay api > api.ticket
```

</CodeTour>

<CodeTour> 

### !!steps Create a configuration file

We're now going to pass the configuration for our local Ockam Node as a JSON file, so
save the configuration to the right into a file named `api.json`.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "private-network-host:8000",
    "relay": "api",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

Ockam Command will process the configuration file after the node starts, instructing the node
to create a portal outlet. An outlet receives message sent to the project relay, named `api`, decrypts them and 
forwards them to the service located at `private-network-host:8000`.

```javascript ! tour
{
// !focus(1:1)
  "tcp-outlet": {
    "to": "private-network-host:8000",
    "relay": "api",
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps

We also define a policy to restrict which are nodes that are expected to be connected to our outlet.

This policy applies Attribute Based Access Controls (ABAC) to allow
other nodes that have the attribute `snowflake` as part of their attested
credentials. The system denies access to nodes without the `snowflake` attribute.

```javascript ! tour
{
  "tcp-inlet": {
    "to": "private-network-host:8000",
    "relay": "api",
// !focus(1:1)
    "allow": "snowflake"
  }
}
```

### !!steps Start the Ockam outlet node

We can now finally start the Ockam outlet node with this command

```shell ! tour
ockam node create --configuration api.json --enrollment-ticket api.ticket
```

</CodeTour> 

## Testing the connection

<CodeTour> 
We are now ready to test access to the remote API, via a fully secure point-to-point connection!

### !!steps Getting data

Let's assume that your HTTP API provides an endpoint named `/customers` to get a list of customers.
You can make a `GET` query to retrieve all the customers as a table:

```sql ! tour
CALL QUERY_REMOTE_API__CONNECTOR.external.get('/customers');
```

### !!steps Getting data with query parameters

You can also parametrize your query with query parameters, provided as a comma-separated list of `key:value`s

```sql ! tour
CALL QUERY_REMOTE_API__CONNECTOR.external.get('/customers', 'min-age:20,max-age:50');
```

### !!steps Getting data with query parameters and headers

Some API also use headers to control the API behaviour. If you need to pass a specific set of headers, you can 
specify them in addition to the query parameters:

```sql ! tour
CALL QUERY_REMOTE_API__CONNECTOR.external.get('/customers', 'min-age:20,max-age:50', 'Content-Language:en-US,X-start-date:2023-01-01');
```

### !!steps Post / Put / Patch data

It is also possible to send data to your API with a `POST` query. This data needs to be sent as a JSON payload:

```sql ! tour
CALL QUERY_REMOTE_API__CONNECTOR.external.POST('/customers', '{"name":"john", "age":50}');
```

### !!steps Delete data

Finally you can delete data with a `DELETE` query to the appropriate endpoint:

```sql ! tour
CALL QUERY_REMOTE_API__CONNECTOR.external.DELETE('/customers/241031');
```

</CodeTour>
