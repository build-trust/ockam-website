In this blog post we will step through a demo of how workforce identities in Okta can be
combined with application identities in Ockam. This allows us to bring policy driven,
attribute-based access control (ABAC) to distributed applications, using cryptographically
verifiable credentials.

## What is Ockam?

[Ockam](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam) is a suite of programming libraries, command
line tools, and managed cloud services to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual
authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy
enforcement &mdash; all at massive scale. Ockam's end-to-end
[secure channels](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/secure-channels) guarantee authenticity,
integrity, and confidentiality of all data-in-motion at the application layer.


## Use employee attributes from Okta to Build Trust with Cryptographically Verifiable Credentials

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that must
trustfully exchange data and instructions.

Authentication is a process where one entity gains assurances about the attributes of another
entity. In other words, it is a process of proving that you are who you say you are.

Authorization is the process of deciding if a request to access a resource should be granted. In
other words, it is a process that grants you the permission to do the "thing" that you are
attempting to do.

## The problem and how Ockam simplifies it

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of interconnections that
must trustfully exchange data and instructions.

In order to trust information or instructions, that are received over the network,
applications must **authenticate** all senders and **verify the integrity of data**
**received** to assert what was received is exactly what was sent — free from errors or
en-route tampering.

Applications must also decide if a sender of a request is **authorized** to trigger the
requested action or view the requested data.

In scenarios where human users are authenticating with cloud services, we have some mature
protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) that help tackle parts of the problem.
However, the majority of data that flows within modern applications doesn’t involve
humans. Microservices interact with other microservices, devices interact with other
devices and cloud services, internal services interact with partner systems and
infrastructure services etc.

**Secure** **by-design** applications must ensure that all machine-to-machine application
layer communication is authenticated and authorized. For this, **applications must prove
identifiers and attributes.**

Ockam allows workforce identities in Okta to be combined with application identities in
Ockam to bring policy driven, attribute-based access control of distributed applications –
using cryptographically verifiable credentials.

### Cryptographically Provable Identifiers

Ockam makes it simple to safely generate unique **cryptographically provable identifiers**
and store their private keys in safe vaults. Ockam Secure Channels enable **mutual
authentication** using these cryptographically provable identifiers.

On this foundation of mutually authenticated secure channels that guarantee end-to-end
data authenticity, integrity and confidentiality, we give you tools to make fine-grained
trust and authorization decisions.

One simple model of trust and authorization that is possible using only cryptographically
provable identifiers is Access Control Lists (ACLs). A resource server is given a list of
identifiers that it will allow access to a resource through an authenticated channel. This
works great for simple scenarios but is hard to scale. As new clients or users need access
to this resource, the access control list has to be updated.

A much more powerful and scalable model becomes feasible with cryptographically provable
credentials.

### Authenticated Attributes and Cryptographic Credentials

When making fine-grained trust and access control decisions, applications often need to
reason about the properties or attributes of an entity that is requesting access to a
resource or reporting some data. For example, an application may require that its
inventory microservice is the only service that is allowed to report the current status of
inventory. For this to work, applications need a way to authenticate attributes.

Ockam enables attribute authentication using **cryptographically verifiable credentials.**

A credential **Verifier** trusts the public identifier of a credential **Authority**. A
**Prover** that wishes to authenticate an attribute to this verifier gets a
cryptographically signed credential from this same credential authority. By issuing a
credential, the authority attests to one or more attributes of the prover. For example the
authority may attest that a particular identifier has the attributes
`service-type=inventory, location="New York"`.

Credentials are issued over mutually authenticated, end-to-end secure channels and carry a
cryptographic signature over an authenticated identifier and its attributes. This then
allows a verifier to check signatures and authenticate attributes.

Once we have authenticated attributes, a resource owner can make trust decisions based on
these attributes rooted in attestations by trusted authorities.

### Credential Authorities and Enrollment Protocols

Any Ockam Identifier can issue credentials about another Identifier, however some
credential authorities are central to the success and scale of a distributed application.
For such authorities Ockam Orchestrator offers highly scalable and secure managed
credential authorities as a cloud service.

We also have to consider how credentials are issued to a large number of application
entities. Ockam offers several pluggable enrollment protocols. Once simple option is to
use one-time-use enrollment tokens. This is a great option to enroll large fleets of
applications, services, or devices. It is also easy to use with automated provisioning
scripts and tools.

### Okta Add-On for Ockam Orchestrator

For most enterprises, workforce identities are already defined in enterprise identity
systems like Okta. Ockam Orchestrator offers an Okta Add-On that uses OIDC to allow
enterprise employees to get Ockam credentials using their regular corporate login.

Their user profile information like department, city, team etc. is included in the
credential and securely attested by the Credential Authority.

This combination is incredibly powerful. It allows **employees to get just-in-time, short
lived, fine-grained revocable credentials to only the application components that they
need to access.** It eliminates long lived static keys and credentials from being stored
on work machines.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's walk through a simple example of Okta + Ockam in action.

We have a distributed application which has microservice components running in San
Francisco and New York. These components have Ockam Identities and Credentials and
communicate trustfully using Ockam Secure Channels.

There is a problem in one of the microservices in San Francisco and we need to give Alice
(an engineer from San Francisco) secure, short lived, revocable access to just that
service and nothing more.

First we'll create our application components and then see how to give access to Alice.

### Required Dependencies

Through this example `https://trial-9434859.okta.com/oauth2/default` refers to an existing
Okta endpoint where workforce identities are defined. The Okta user profile is expected
to contain `email`, `city` and `department` attributes. These attributes will be included
on the generated Ockam credentials.

<Alert status='info'>
  If you don't have an Okta install already, you can create a [trial
  account](https://www.okta.com/free-trial/) to follow this example use case.
</Alert>

### Setup

If you use Homebrew, you can install Ockam using `brew`.

```bash
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
```

Otherwise, you can download our latest architecture specific pre-compiled binary by running:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/build-trust/ockam/develop/install.sh | sh
```

After the binary downloads, please move it to a location in your shell's `$PATH`, like
`/usr/local/bin`.

<Alert status='info'>
  You can find more information on getting started and installing Ockam
  [here](https://docs.ockam.io/#install).
</Alert>

### Administrator

Next we provision our system. We enroll with Ockam Orchestrator, enable the Okta Add-On
and export the project configuration to share with Alice.

```bash
ockam enroll
ockam project addon configure okta \
  --tenant https://trial-9434859.okta.com/oauth2/default --client-id 0oa2pi8no6Kb04frP697 \
  --attribute email --attribute city --attribute department

ockam project information --output json > project.json
```

This will create a managed Credential Authority for our project.

Next we generate two one-time-use enrollment tokens to enable Machine 1 and 2 to enroll
and get credentials. Notice how we specify the attributes to attest for these two
machines: `city` and `application`.

```bash
m1_token=$(ockam project ticket --attribute application="Smart Factory" --attribute city="San Francisco")
m2_token=$(ockam project ticket --attribute application="Smart Factory" --attribute city="New York")
```

### Machine 1 in New York

We'll represent the application service on Machine 1 with a simple http server listening
on port `5000` but this could be any application service:

```bash
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 5000
```

Next we transfer project configuration and one enrollment token to Machine 1 and use that
to create an Ockam node that will run as a sidecar process next to our application
service.

```bash
ockam identity create m1
ockam project enroll $m1_token --identity m1
ockam node create m1 --identity m1
ockam policy create --at m1 --resource tcp-outlet \
  --expression '(or (= subject.application "Smart Factory") (and (= subject.department "Field Engineering") (= subject.city "San Francisco")))'
ockam tcp-outlet create --at /node/m1 --from /service/outlet --to 127.0.0.1:5000
ockam relay create m1 --at /project/default --to /node/m1
```

We then set an attribute based policy on the tcp-outlet that delivers traffic to our
application service. This policy says to allow requests if the subject (the entity
requesting access) is part of the same application or if the subject is a Field Engineer
based in San Francisco.

```js
(or (= subject.application "Smart Factory")
    (and (= subject.department "Field Engineering") (= subject.city "San Francisco")))
```

The first part of the policy allows various application component services to communicate
with each other. The second part is what will enable Alice. However, note that there is no
mention of Alice here, only a department and a city.

### Machine 2 in San Francisco

We'll represent the application service on Machine 2 with a simple http server listening
on port `6000` but this could be any application service:

```bash
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 6000
```

Next we transfer project configuration and one enrollment token to Machine 2 and use that
to create and Ockam node that will run as a sidecar process next to our application
service.

```bash
ockam identity create m2
ockam project enroll $m2_token --identity m2
ockam node create m2 --identity m2
ockam policy create --at m2 --resource tcp-outlet \
  --expression '(or (= subject.application "Smart Factory") (and (= subject.department "Field Engineering") (= subject.city "New York")))'
ockam tcp-outlet create --at /node/m2 --from /service/outlet --to 127.0.0.1:6000
ockam relay create m2 --at /project/default --to /node/m2
```

Same as before, we then set an attribute based policy on the the tcp-outlet that delivers
traffic to our application service. This policy says to allow requests if the subject (the
entity requesting access) is part of the same application or if the subject is a Field
Engineer based in New York.

```js
(or (= subject.application "Smart Factory")
    (and (= subject.department "Field Engineering") (= subject.city "New York")))
```

### Engineer for San Francisco

There is a problem in one of the microservices in San Francisco and we need to give Alice
(an engineer from San Francisco) secure, short lived, revocable access to just that
service and nothing more.

Since the Okta Add-On is enabled. Alice can simply start a node within the project and
authenticate.

```bash
ockam project enroll --project-path project.json --okta
ockam node create alice
ockam policy create --at alice --resource tcp-inlet --expression '(= subject.application "Smart Factory")'
```

The `project enroll` command will launch Okta login and when it completes return an Ockam
cryptographic credential that includes the city and department attributes of Alice's
profile in Okta Universal Directory. Only these two attributes are attested because the
administrator specified those two attributes when enabling the Okta Add-On.

![User Profile in Okta](/blog/okta/screenshot.png)

Alice's `city` in Okta is "San Francisco". Her request to access Machine 1 in San
Francisco is allowed.

```bash
ockam tcp-inlet create --at /node/alice --from 127.0.0.1:8000 \
  --to /project/default/service/forward_to_m1/secure/api/service/outlet
curl --head 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Her request to access Machine 2 in New York is denied.

```bash
ockam tcp-inlet create --at /node/alice --from 127.0.0.1:9000 \
  --to /project/default/service/forward_to_m2/secure/api/service/outlet
curl --head 127.0.0.1:9000

# this will do nothing and eventually timeout
```

When new employees join the Field Engineering team in San Francisco, they will get an Okta
workforce identity and can also request access to services they are responsible for in San
Francisco without any change to the system.

## Next steps

Ockam and Okta allow attribute based policies to easily span the spectrum of "very simple"
to "highly fine-grained and dynamic" depending on the needs of an application. At the same
time, this approach is highly scalable because it decouples enterprise identity
administration from an application's trust policies.

Here are some good jumping off points to learn more about Ockam:
- Install [Ockam command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam#install-ockam-command)
  (`ockam` command) on your computer and try to
  [create end-to-end encrypted communication](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam#end-to-end-encrypted-and-mutually-authenticated-communication)
  between two apps.
- Learn about other [use cases](https://docs.ockam.io/guides/use-cases) where Ockam can
  help secure your infrastructure with ease.
