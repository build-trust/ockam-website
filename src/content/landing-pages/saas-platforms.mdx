      Your customers get the user experience they deserve. Instead of pushing all 
      the hard connectivity problems, such as setting up VPNs or changing firewall 
      configurations, you can offer a holistic solution that feels like a natural
      _part of your product_.

      Provide them a custom `your-company-agent` to run that will have their systems
      connected within minutes.

      Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
      network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
      lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

      By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
      fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
      assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
      push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
      established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

      Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no 
      matter which cloud your customers are using, or if they're using multiple 
      clouds, you've a single approach that works consistently wherever your customers
      are. That includes other on-prem environments, data centers, or even a server 
      that's under someone's desk.

      Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
      technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
      [publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
      the implementations are 
      [open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

      Also available is a published and independent third-party audit by
      the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com).

steps:
  - heading: Create an agent
    text: | 
      Either add Ockam to your existing distribution, or wrap one of our existing
      deployment options with your own branding to a custom package within minutes. 
    image: create-an-agent
  - heading: Customer runs your agent
    text: |
      Add a way for a customer to request a ticket. They then run your agent, 
      passing in the ticket. That's all they have to do! No managing hostnames 
      or routes, changing ingress rules on firewalls.

  - heading: Connect to your customer
    text: | 
      Whenever you need to connect to the customer system start an Ockam Inlet. A 
      mutually authenticated secure portal will be immediately established. 
      And via what we call [virtual adjacency](/) the customer system will be 
      accessible as though it was running on `localhost`. All without the need to 
      for the customer to make their systems reachable from the public internet. And
      without the risk of you being able to reach anything else in their network due 
      to a misconfiguration on their end. A true point to point connection. Exactly
      what you need, and nothing more.
