  - title: App-to-app trust
    image: app-level
    text: |
      Meeting modern data control expectations requires guarantees that the 
      intended applications are exclusively the apps that can connect to your 
      systems. Ockam moves trust to the application layer by building a mutually 
      authenticated and encrypted communication channel between those systems.
  - title: No more shared secret keys
    image: kafka-key-layers
    animate: true
    text: |
      Sharing secret keys across many apps and services increases the likelihood 
      of secret keys leaking, in addition to eroding any guarantees that only 
      intended apps can access sensitive data. Teams then layer in additional 
      credential management approaches, network-level controls, and various other 
      security approaches in an attempt to have a somewhat reliable assumption 
      that only the intended app(s) were able to use the shared secret keys.

      With Ockam, each app generates it's own _unique_ cryptographically provable 
      identity and encryption keys, and uses those keys to establish trusted 
      secure channels directly with other authorized apps as required.
  - title: No more shipping secrets
    image: shared-key-shipping-exposure-risk
    text: |
      Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, 
      or  transmitting a secret key to another app, every time a secret value is 
      transmitted over the wire is another opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's 
      approach to secret management means each secret key never needs to leave 
      the place where it was generated. By removing the need to transmit secrets 
      the risk of an attacker intercepting a secret in transit is also removed.
  - title: Automated & regular key-rotation
    image: automated-key-rotation
    text: |
      Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact 
      in case the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate 
      their encryption keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is 
      reduced to the amount sent in the small window of that secret key was 
      active. Don't put your historical and future data at risk because rotating 
      secret keys is difficult&mdash; it's built-in from the start.
  - title: Data authenticity & integrity
    image: guaranteed-authenticity
    text: |
      The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides 
      results in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and 
      integrity of the data moving through your system. 
  - title: Trust your security team can depend on
    image: certification-logos
    text: |
      Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
      technologies and frameworks. We build trust through transparency so your 
      CISO can be confident everything meets their requirements. The 
      cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
      [publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
      the implementations are 
      [open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam). 

      We've published an independent third-party audit by
      the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com), 
      we've passed the security reviews of our major partners, and we're SOC2
      compliant.
      
      The [current status of our latest audits and compliance controls](https://audits.ockam.io) 
      are also available.  
  - title: No need to run Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    image: no-pki
    text: |
      Nobody loves running their own PKI. It's complicated, you still need to 
      work out how to securely handle your root certificate and keys, have 
      policies around  lifecycle management&hellip; a lot of extra 
      infrastructure and orchestration.

      With Ockam, each app generates keys and establishes trust directly there's 
      no  need to run your own PKI systems.
  - title: Any language
    image: any-language
    text: |
      Ockam can work with any language. You've the flexibility to write your 
      applications in a mix of Java, Python, Go, Scala, you name it!
  - title: Complete multi-cloud support
    image: multicloud
    text: |
      Ockam is agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. Whatever
      cloud you're on, even if you're running a multi-cloud setup, Ockam is a 
      single approach that will provide secure point-to-point wherever you need 
      it.
