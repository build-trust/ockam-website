    title: Unique keys per identity
    text: Each consumer and producer generates its own cryptographic keys, and is issued its own unique credentials. They then use these to establish a mutually trusted secure channel between each other. By removing the dependency on a third-party service to store or distribute keys you're able to reduce your vulnerability surface area and eliminate single points of failure.

    title: Tamper-proof data transfer
    text: By pushing control of keys to the edges of the system, where authenticated encryption and decryption occurs, no other parties in the supply-chain are able to modify the data in transit. You can be assured that the data you receive at the consumer is exactly what was sent by your producers. You can also be assured that only authorised producers can write to a topic ensuring that the data in your topic is highly trustworthy.

    title: Reduced exposure window
    text: Ockam secure channels regularly rotate authentication keys and session secrets. This approach means that if one of those session secrets was exposed your total data exposure window is limited to the small duration that secret was in use. Rotating authentication keys means that even when the identity keys of a producer are compromised - no historical data is compromised. You can selectively remove the compromised producer and its data. With centralised shared key distribution approaches there is the risk that all current and historical data can’t be trusted after a breach because it may have been tampered with or stolen. Ockam's approach eliminates the risk of compromised historical data and minimises the risk to future data using automatically rotating keys.

## App-to-app trust

Kafka applications that are handling sensitive data require more than encryption
to the "end". Where's the "end"? What's needed to meet modern data governance 
expectations are guarantees that the intended applications are exclusively the
apps that can participate in a sensitive message stream. Ockam moves trust to 
the application layer by building a mutually authenticated and encrypted 
communication channel between all of your Kafka apps _through_ your Kafka brokers.
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="kafka-key-layers" animate startAt={0}>
## No more shared secret keys

Sharing secret keys across many apps and services increases the likelihood of
secret keys leaking, in addition to eroding any guarantees that only intended apps can
access sensitive data. Teams then layer in additional credential management 
approaches, network-level controls, and various other security approaches in
an attempt to have a somewhat reliable assumption that only the intended app(s)
were able to use the shared secret keys.

With Ockam, each Kafka app generates it's own _unique_ cryptographically provable identity 
and encryption keys, and uses those keys to establish trusted secure channels directly 
with other authorized apps as required.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="shared-key-shipping-exposure-risk">
## No more shipping secrets

Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, or 
transmitting a secret key to another app, every time a secret value is transmitted
over the wire is another opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's approach to secret 
management means each secret key never needs to leave the place where it was 
generated. By removing the need to transmit secrets the risk of an attacker 
intercepting a secret in transit is also removed.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="automated-key-rotation">
## Automated & regular key-rotation

Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact incase
the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate their encryption
keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is reduced to the amount sent
in the small window of that secret key was active. Don't put your 
historical and future data at risk because rotating secret keys is difficult &mdash; 
it's built-in from the start.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="guaranteed-authenticity">
## Data authenticity & integrity

The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system. 
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="no-pki">
## No need to run Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Nobody loves running their own PKI. It's complicated, you still need to work out
how to securely handle your root certificate and keys, have policies around 
lifecycle management&hellip; a lot of extra infrastructure and orchestration.

With Ockam, each app generates keys and establishes trust directly there's no 
need to run your own PKI systems.
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="kafka-any-language">
## Any language

The Kafka add-on for Ockam can work with any language. You've the flexibility
to write your producers and consumers in a mix of Java, Python, Go, Scala, you 
name it!
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="no-code-changes">
## No app code changes

Just a single configuration change: update the broker host to point to the secure channel
that Ockam sets up on `localhost` for each app. It takes a couple of seconds,
and won't require you to change any of the business logic or implementation in your
apps.
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="cloud-on-prem">
## Self-managed deployments

Running Kafka yourself? Maybe a managed offering inside you own VPC? Ockam 
works wherever you need it.
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="kafka-heterogeneous">
## Heterogeneous deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. Run a mix of apps
across the major cloud vendors to access specific value-add services without 
the complication of configuring secure cross-cloud access to a specific KMS or
setting services like Private Link or VPC Peering.
