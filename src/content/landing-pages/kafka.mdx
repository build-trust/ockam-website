features:
  - title: App-to-app trust
    image: kafka-encrypted-ockam
    text: |
      Kafka applications that are handling sensitive data require more than 
      encryption to the "end". Where's the "end"? What's needed to meet modern 
      data governance expectations are guarantees that the intended applications 
      are exclusively the apps that can participate in a sensitive message 
      stream. Ockam moves trust to the application layer by building a 
      mutually authenticated and encrypted communication channel between all of 
      your Kafka apps _through_ your Kafka brokers.
  - title: No more shared secret keys
    image: kafka-key-layers
    animate: true
    text: |
      Sharing secret keys across many apps and services increases the likelihood 
      of secret keys leaking, in addition to eroding any guarantees that only intended apps can
      access sensitive data. Teams then layer in additional credential management 
      approaches, network-level controls, and various other security approaches in
      an attempt to have a somewhat reliable assumption that only the intended app(s)
      were able to use the shared secret keys.

      With Ockam, each Kafka app generates it's own _unique_ cryptographically provable identity 
      and encryption keys, and uses those keys to establish trusted secure channels directly 
      with other authorized apps as required.
  - title: No more shipping secrets
    image: shared-key-shipping-exposure-risk
    text: |
      Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, or 
      transmitting a secret key to another app, every time a secret value is transmitted
      over the wire is another opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's approach to secret 
      management means each secret key never needs to leave the place where it was 
      generated. By removing the need to transmit secrets the risk of an attacker 
      intercepting a secret in transit is also removed.
  - title: Automated & regular key-rotation
    image: automated-key-rotation
    text: |
      Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact incase
      the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate their encryption
      keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is reduced to the amount sent
      in the small window of that secret key was active. Don't put your 
      historical and future data at risk because rotating secret keys is difficult &mdash; 
      it's built-in from the start.
  - title: Data authenticity & integrity
    image: guaranteed-authenticity
    text: |
      The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
      in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
      the messages moving through your system. 
  - title: No need to run Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    image: no-pki
    text: |
      Nobody loves running their own PKI. It's complicated, you still need to work out
      how to securely handle your root certificate and keys, have policies around 
      lifecycle management&hellip; a lot of extra infrastructure and orchestration.

      With Ockam, each app generates keys and establishes trust directly there's no 
      need to run your own PKI systems.
  - title: Any language
    image: kafka-any-language
    text: |
      The Kafka add-on for Ockam can work with any language. You've the flexibility
      to write your producers and consumers in a mix of Java, Python, Go, Scala, you 
      name it!
  - title: No app code changes
    image: no-code-changes
    text: |
      Just a single configuration change: update the broker host to point to the secure channel
      that Ockam sets up on `localhost` for each app. It takes a couple of seconds,
      and won't require you to change any of the business logic or implementation in your
      apps.
  - title: Self-managed deployments
    image: cloud-on-prem
    text: |
      Running Kafka yourself? Maybe a managed offering inside you own VPC? Ockam 
      works wherever you need it.
  - title: Heterogeneous deployments
    image: kafka-heterogeneous
    text: |
      Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. Run a mix of apps
      across the major cloud vendors to access specific value-add services without 
      the complication of configuring secure cross-cloud access to a specific KMS or
      setting services like Private Link or VPC Peering.
  - title: Available today
    image: available-today
    text: |
      All of these features are available and production ready, today. There's no
      waiting to get accepted into a beta program, for a professional services
      team to draft a statement of work, or to even speak to our sales team (though
      we would still love to speak with you!). You can [create an account for free](https://www.ockam.io/download)
