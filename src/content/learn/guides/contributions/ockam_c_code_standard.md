title: C Library Style
order: 4

# C ​Library Coding Standard

This guide will help us keep the style in our C Library consistent.

## Names

### Make Names Fit

Names are the heart of programming. In the past people believed knowing someone's true
name gave them magical power over that person. If you can think up the true name for
something, you give yourself and the people coming after power over the code. Don't laugh!
A name is the result of a long deep thought process about the ecology it lives in. Only a
programmer who understands the system as a whole can create a name that "fits" with the
system. If the name is appropriate everything fits together naturally, relationships are clear,
meaning is derivable, and reasoning from common human expectations works as expected.

If you find all your names could be Thing and DoIt then you should probably revisit your design.

### Function Names

* Usually every function performs an action, so the name should make clear what it does:
check_for_errors() instead of error_check(), dump_data_to_file() instead of data_file().
This will also make functions and data objects more distinguishable.
Structs are often nouns. By making function names verbs and following other naming
conventions programs can be read more naturally.
* Suffixes are sometimes useful:
  * max ​ - to mean the maximum value something can have.
  * count ​ - the current count of a running count variable.
  * key ​ - key value.
* For example: retry_max to mean the maximum number of retries, retry_cnt to mean the
current retry count.
* Prefixes are sometimes useful:
  * is ​ - to ask a question about something. Whenever someone sees ​ Is ​ they will
know it's a question.
  * get ​ - get a value.
  * set ​ - set a value.
* For example: is_hit_retry_limit.

### Variable Naming & Declarations

* Variable declarations should be limited to one per line.
* Variables should be descriptively named, using abbreviations sparingly if at all.
* Words should be separated by underscores.
* Variables should be all lower case
* Global variables should be prefixed with g_
* Pointer variables should be prefixed with p_
* g_ takes precedence over p_
* Variables should always be initialized

```c
char* g_p_remote_host_dns_name = “www.ockam.io”;
int*  p_bytes_received = NULL;
int   buffer_size = MAX_BUFFER_SIZE;
```

### Include Units in Names

If a variable represents time, weight, or some other unit then include the unit in the name so
developers can more easily spot problems.

```c
uint32 timeout_msecs;
uint32 my_weight_lbs;
```

### Structure Names

* Use underbars ('_') to separate name components.
* When declaring variables in structures, declare them organized by use in a manner to
attempt to minimize memory wastage because of compiler alignment issues, then by
size, and then by alphabetical order. E.g, don't use ``int a; char *b; int c; char *d''; use
``int a; int b; char *c; char *d''. Each variable gets its own type and line, although an
exception can be made when declaring bitfields (to clarify that it's part of the one bitfield).
Note that the use of bitfields in general is discouraged. Major structures should be
declared at the top of the file in which they are used, or in separate header files, if they
are used in multiple source files. Use of the structures should be by separate
declarations and should be "extern" if they are declared in a header file. It may be useful
to use a meaningful prefix for each member name. E.g, for ``struct softc'' the prefix could
be ``sc_''.

```c
struct foo {
    struct foo *next; /* List of active foo */
    struct mumble amumble; /* Comment for mumble */
    int bar;
    unsigned int baz:1, /* Bitfield */
    fuz:5,
    zap:2;
    uint8_t flag;
};
struct foo *foohead; /* Head of global foo list */
```

### Pointer Variables

Place the * with the type, and declare only one variable per line

```c
char* p_name= NULL;
char  address[80];
```

### Global Constants

Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.

**Justification**

It's tradition for global constants to named this way. You must be careful to not conflict with
other global ​ _#define_ ​s and enum labels.

```c
const int A_GLOBAL_CONSTANT= 5;
```

### #define and Macro Names

Put #defines and macros in all upper using '_' separators. Macros are capitalized,
parenthesized, and should avoid side-effects. Spacing before and after the macro name
may be any whitespace, though use of TABs should be consistent through a file. If they
are an inline expansion of a function, the function is defined all in lowercase, the macro
has the same name all in uppercase. If the macro is an expression, wrap the expression
in parenthesis. If the macro is more than a single statement, use ``do { ... } while (0)'', so
that a trailing semicolon works. Right-justify the backslashes; it makes it easier to read.

**Justification**

This makes it very clear that the value is not alterable and in the case of macros, makes it clear
that you are using a construct that requires care.
Some subtle errors can occur when macro names and enum labels use the same name.

```c
#define MAX(a,b) blah
#define IS_ERR(err) blah
#define MACRO(v, w, x, y)

do {
    v = (x) + (y);
    w = (y) + 2;
} while (0);
```

### Enum Names

#### Labels All Upper Case with '_' Word Separators

This is the standard rule for enum labels. No comma on the last element.

```c
enum PinStateType {
    PIN_STATE_UNINITIALIZED,,
    PIN_OFF,
    PIN_ON
};
```

#### Make a Label for an Error State

It's often useful to be able to say an enum is not in any of its ​ _valid_ ​ states. Make a label for an
uninitialized or error state. Make it the first label if possible.

```c
enum { STATE_ERR, STATE_OPEN, STATE_RUNNING, STATE_DYING};
```

## Formatting

### Braces

**Placement**

Of the three major brace placement strategies one is recommended:

```c
if (condition) {
    while (condition) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

**When Braces are Needed**

All if, while and do statements must either have braces or be on a single line.

**Always Uses Braces Form**

All if, while and do statements require braces even if there is only a single statement within the
braces.

```c
if (1 == somevalue) {
    somevalue = 2;
}
```

**Justification**

It ensures that when someone adds a line of code later there are already braces and they don't
forget. It provides a more consistent look. This doesn't affect execution speed. It's easy to do.

**One Line Form**

```c
if (1 == somevalue) somevalue = 2;
```

**Justification**

It provides safety when adding new lines while maintaining a compact readable form.

**Add Comments to Closing Braces**

Adding a comment to closing braces can help when you are reading code because you don't
have to find the begin brace to know what is going on.

```c
while(1) {
    if (valid) {
    } /* if valid */
    else {
    } /* not valid */
} /* end forever */
```

### Consider Screen Size Limits

Some people like blocks to fit within a common screen size so scrolling is not necessary when
reading code.

### Parens () with Key Words and Functions Policy

* Do not put parens next to keywords. Put a space between.
* Do put parens next to function names.
* Do not use parens in return statements when it's not necessary.

**Justification**

Keywords are not functions. By putting parens next to keywords keywords and function names are made to look alike.

```c
if (condition) {
}
while (condition) {
}

strcpy(s, s1);
return 1;
```

### A Line Should Not Exceed 120 Characters

Lines should not exceed 120 characters.

### If Then Else Formatting

#### Layout

It's up to the programmer. Different bracing styles will yield slightly different looks. One common
approach is:

```c
if (condition) {
} else if (condition) {
} else {
}
```

Also acceptable:

```c
if (condition) {
}
else if (condition) {
} else {
}
```

If you have ​ _else if_ ​ statements then it is usually a good idea to always have an else block for
finding unhandled cases. Maybe put a log message in the else even if there is no corrective
action taken.

#### Condition Format

Always put the constant on the left hand side of an equality/inequality comparison. For example:

```c
if ( 6 == errorNum ) ...
```

One reason is that if you leave out one of the = signs, the compiler will find the error for you. A
second reason is that it puts the value you are looking for right up front where you can find it
instead of buried at the end of your expression. It takes a little time to get used to this format,
but then it really gets useful.

### switch Formatting

* Falling through a case statement into the next case statement shall be permitted as long
as a comment is included.
* The ​ default ​ case should always be present and trigger an error if it should not be
reached, yet is reached.
* If you need to create variables put all the code in a block.
* Prefer putting all code in blocks

```c
switch (...)
{
    case 1:
    {
        ...
        /* comments */
    }
    case 2:
    {
        int v;
        ...
        break;
    }
    case 3:
    {
       ...
    }
    default:
}
```

### Use of goto, continue, break and ?:

#### Goto

Goto statements should be used in only one situation, and that is to skip to the end of a function
when an unrecoverable error occurs. Use the label “exit”, and perform all function-related
cleanup in that block.

```c
for (...) {
    while (...) {
        ...
        if (disaster) {
            goto exit_block;
        }
    }
}
...
exit:
...do all function cleanup here...
return status;
```

#### Continue and Break

Continue and break are really disguised gotos so they are covered here.
Continue and break like goto should be used sparingly as they are magic in code. With a simple
spell the reader is beamed to god knows where for some usually undocumented reason.
The two main problems with continue are:
* It may bypass the test condition
* It may bypass the increment/decrement expression
Consider the following example where both problems occur:

```c
while (TRUE) {
    ...
    /* A lot of code */
    ...
    if (/* some condition */) {
        continue;
    }
    ...
    /* A lot of code */
    ...
    if ( i++ > STOP_VALUE) break;
}
```

"A lot of code" is necessary in order that the problem cannot be caught easily by the
programmer.

From the above example, a further rule may be given: Mixing continue with break in the same
loop is a sure way to disaster.

#### Using ?: expressions

The trouble is people usually try and stuff too much code in between the ​_?_ ​ and ​ _:_ ​. Here are a
couple of clarity rules to follow:
* Put the condition in parens so as to set it off from other code
* If possible, the actions for the test should be simple functions.
* Put the action for the then and else statement on a separate line unless it can be clearly
put on one line.

```c
(condition)? funct1() : func2();
or
(condition)
? long statement
: another long statement;
```

### One Statement Per Line

There should be only one statement per line unless the statements are very closely related.

**Justification**

The code is easier to read. Use some white space too. Nothing better than to read code
that is one line after another with no white space or comments.

#### One Variable Per Line

Related to this is always define one variable per line:

**Do:**

```c
int  count = 0;
int* p_bytes_received = NULL;
```

**Don’t:**

```c
int *p_bytes_received, count;
```

**Justification**

* Documentation can be added for the variable on the line.
* It's clear that the variables are initialized.
* Declarations are clear which reduces the probability of declaring a pointer when you
   meant to declare just a char.

### To Use Enums or Not to Use Enums

C allows constant variables, which should deprecate the use of enums as constants.
Unfortunately, in most compilers constants take space. Some compilers will remove constants,
but not all. Constants taking space precludes them from being used in tight memory
environments like embedded systems. Workstation users should use constants and ignore the
rest of this discussion.

In general enums are preferred to ​ _#define_ ​ as enums are understood by the debugger.
Be aware enums are not of a guaranteed size. So if you have a type that can take a known
range of values and it is transported in a message you can't use an enum as the type. Use the
correct integer size and use constants or ​ _#define_ ​. Casting between integers and enums is very
error prone as you could cast a value not in the enum.

### Use Header File Guards

Include files should protect against multiple inclusion through the use of macros that "guard" the
files. Note that for C++ compatibility and interoperability reasons, do ​ **not** ​ use underscores '_' as
the first or last character of a header guard.

```c
#ifndef sys_socket_h
#define sys_socket_h /* NOT _sys_socket_h_ */
#endif
```

## Macros

**Mostly Don’t Use Them**

Macros can cause readability problems and can be difficult to debug. Avoid using macros
unless there’s a remarkably compelling reason to do so.

**Prefer Inline Functions**

In C, macros are not needed for code efficiency. Use inlines. While macros for small functions
aren’t a travesty, inline functions should be preferred.


```c
#define MAX(x,y) (((x) > (y)? (x) : (y)) // Get the maximum
```

The macro above can be replaced for integers with the following inline function with no loss of
efficiency:

```c
inline int max(int x, int y) {
    return (x > y? x : y);
}
```

**Be Careful of Side Effects**

Macros should be used with caution because of the potential for error when invoked with an
expression that has side effects.

```c
MAX(f(x),z++);
```

**Always Wrap the Expression in Parenthesis**

When putting expressions in macros always wrap the expression in parenthesis to avoid
potential communitive operation ambiguity.

```c
#define ADD(x,y) x + y
```

must be written as

```c
#define ADD(x,y) ((x) + (y))
```

**Make Macro Names Unique**

Like global variables macros can conflict with macros from other packages.

* Prepend macro names with package names.
* Avoid simple and common names like MAX and MIN.

## Initialize all Variables

You shall always initialize variables. Always. Every time. gcc with the flag -W may catch
operations on uninitialized variables, but it may also not.

**Justification**

More problems than you can believe are eventually traced back to a pointer or variable
left uninitialized.

## Short Functions

Functions should limit themselves to a page or two of code.

**Justification**

* The idea is that the each method represents a technique for achieving a single objective.
* Most arguments of inefficiency turn out to be false in the long run.
* True function calls are slower than not, but there needs to be a thought out decision (see
  premature optimization).

## Document Null Statements

Always document a null body for a for or while statement so that it is clear that the null body is
intentional and not missing code.

```c
while (*dest++ = *src++)
{
    ;
}
```

## Do Not Default If Test to Non-Zero

Do not default the test for non-zero, i.e.

```c
if (FAIL != f())
```

is better than

```c
if (f())
```

Even though FAIL may have the value 0 which C considers to be false. An explicit test will help
you out later when somebody decides that a failure return should be -1 instead of 0. Explicit
comparison should be used even if the comparison value will never change; e.g., ​ **if (!(bufsize %
sizeof(int)))** ​ should be written instead as ​ **if ((bufsize % sizeof(int)) == 0)** ​ to reflect the numeric
(not boolean) nature of the test. A frequent trouble spot is using strcmp to test for string equality,
where the result should ​ _never_ ​ ​ _ever_ ​ be defaulted. The preferred approach is to ​use an inline
method:

```c
inline bool string_equal(char* a, char* b)
{
    (strcmp(a, b) == 0)? return true : return false;
}
```

Note, this is just an example, you should really use the standard library string type for doing the
comparison.

The non-zero test is often defaulted for predicates and other functions or expressions which
meet the following restrictions:
* Returns 0 for false, nothing else.
* Is named so that the meaning of (say) a ​ true ​ return is absolutely obvious. Call a
predicate is_valid(), not check_valid().

## Usually Avoid Embedded Assignments

There is a time and a place for embedded assignment statements. In some constructs there is
no better way to accomplish the results without making the code bulkier and less readable.

```c
while (EOF != (c = getchar())) {
    ...process the character
}
```

The ++ and -- operators count as assignment statements. So, for many purposes, do functions
with side effects. Using embedded assignment statements to improve run-time performance is
also possible. However, one should consider the tradeoff between increased speed and
decreased maintainability that results when embedded assignments are used in artificial places.

For example,

```c
a = b + c;
d = a + r;
```

should not be replaced by

```c
d = (a = b + c) + r;
```

even though the latter may save one cycle. In the long run the time difference between the two
will decrease as the optimizer gains maturity, while the difference in ease of maintenance will
increase as the human memory of what's going on in the latter piece of code begins to fade.

## Documentation

**Comments Should Tell a Story**

Consider your comments a story describing the system. Expect your comments to be extracted
by a robot and formed into a man page. Class comments are one part of the story, method
signature comments are another part of the story, method arguments another part, and method
implementation yet another part. All these parts should weave together and inform someone
else at another point of time just exactly what you did and why.

**Document Decisions**

Comments should document decisions. At every point where you had a choice of what to do
place a comment describing which choice you made and why. Archeologists will find this the
most useful information.

**Use Headers**

Use ​Doxygen​.

These headers are structured in such a way as they can be parsed and extracted. They are not
useless like normal headers. So take time to fill them out. If you do it right once no more
documentation may be necessary.

**Comment Layout**

Each part of the project has a specific comment layout. ​Doxygen​ has the recommended format
for the comment layouts.

**Make Gotchas Explicit**

Explicitly comment variables changed out of the normal control flow or other code likely to break
during maintenance. Embedded keywords are used to point out issues and potential problems.
Consider a robot will parse your comments looking for keywords, stripping them out, and making
a report so people can make a special effort where needed.

**Gotcha Keywords**

* @author:
specifies the author of the module

* @version:
specifies the version of the module

* @param:
specifies a parameter into a function

* @return:
specifies what a function returns

* @deprecated:
says that a function is not to be used anymore

* @see:
creates a link in the documentation to the file/function/variable to consult to get a better
understanding on what the current block of code does.

* @todo:
what remains to be done

* @bug:
report a bug found in the piece of code


**Gotcha Formatting**

* Make the gotcha keyword the first symbol in the comment.
* Comments may consist of multiple lines, but the first line should be a self-containing,
meaningful summary.
* The writer's name and the date of the remark should be part of the comment. This
information is in the source repository, but it can take a quite a while to find out when
and by whom it was added. Often gotchas stick around longer than they should.
Embedding date information allows other programmer to make this decision. Embedding
who information lets us know who to ask.

**Commenting function declarations**

Functions headers should be in the file where they are declared. This means that most likely the
functions will have a header in the .h file. However, functions like main() with no explicit
prototype declaration in the .h file, should have a header in the .c file.

**Include Statement Documentation**

Include statements should be documented, telling the user why a particular file was included.

/*
* Kernel include files come first.
*/

/* Non-local includes in brackets. */
/*
* If it's a network program, put the network include files next.
* Group the includes files by subdirectory.
*/

/*
* Then there's a blank line, followed by the /usr include files.
* The /usr include files should be sorted!
*/

## Layering

Layering is the primary technique for reducing complexity in a system. A system should be
divided into layers. Layers should communicate between adjacent layers using well defined
interfaces. When a layer uses a non-adjacent layer then a layering violation has occurred.
A layering violation simply means we have dependency between layers that is not controlled by
a well defined interface. When one of the layers changes code could break. We don't want code
to break so we want layers to work only with other adjacent layers.

Sometimes we need to jump layers for performance reasons. This is fine, but we should know
we are doing it and document appropriately.

## Miscellaneous

### General advice

This section contains some miscellaneous do's and don'ts.

* Don't use floating-point variables where discrete values are needed. Using a float for a
loop counter is a great way to shoot yourself in the foot. Always test floating-point
numbers as <= or >=, never use an exact comparison (== or !=).

* Compilers have bugs. Common trouble spots include structure assignment and bit fields.
You cannot generally predict which bugs a compiler has. You could write a program that
avoids all constructs that are known broken on all compilers. You won't be able to write
anything useful, you might still encounter bugs, and the compiler might get fixed in the
meanwhile. Thus, you should write ``around'' compiler bugs only when you are forced to
use a particular buggy compiler.

* Do not rely on automatic beautifiers. The main person who benefits from good program
style is the programmer him/herself, and especially in the early design of handwritten
algorithms or pseudo-code. Automatic beautifiers can only be applied to complete,
syntactically correct programs and hence are not available when the need for attention
to white space and indentation is greatest. Programmers can do a better job of making
clear the complete visual layout of a function or file, with the normal attention to detail of
a careful programmer (in other words, some of the visual layout is dictated by intent
rather than syntax and beautifiers cannot read minds). Sloppy programmers should learn
to be careful programmers instead of relying on a beautifier to make their code readable.
Finally, since beautifiers are non-trivial programs that must parse the source, a
sophisticated beautifier is not worth the benefits gained by such a program. Beautifiers
are best for gross formatting of machine-generated code.

* Accidental omission of the second ``='' of the logical compare is a problem. The following is
confusing and prone to error.

```c
if (abool= bbool) { ... }
```

Does the programmer really mean assignment here? Often yes, but usually no. The solution is
to just not do it, an inverse Nike philosophy. Instead use explicit tests and avoid assignment with
an implicit test. The recommended form is to do the assignment before doing the test:

```c
abool= bbool;
if (abool) { ... }
```

* Modern compilers will put variables in registers automatically. Use the register sparingly
to indicate the variables that you think are most critical. In extreme cases, mark the 2-4
most critical values as register and mark the rest as REGISTER. The latter can be

#defined to register on those machines with many registers.

### Be Const Correct

C provides the ​ _const_ ​ key word to allow passing as parameters objects that cannot change to
indicate when a method doesn't modify its object. Using const in all the right places is called
"const correctness." It's hard at first, but using const really tightens up your coding style. Const
correctness grows on you.

### Use #if Not #ifdef

Use #if MACRO not #ifdef MACRO. Someone might write code like:

```c
#ifdef DEBUG
temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
```

Someone else might compile the code with turned-of debug info like:
cc -c lurker.cc -DDEBUG=0
Alway use #if, if you have to use the preprocessor. This works fine, and does the right thing,
even if DEBUG is not defined at all (!)

```c
#if DEBUG
temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
```

If you really need to test whether a symbol is defined or not, test it with the defined() construct,
which allows you to add more things later to the conditional without editing text that's already in
the program:

```c
#if !defined(USER_NAME)
#define USER_NAME "john smith"
#endif
```

### Commenting Out Large Code Blocks

Sometimes large blocks of code need to be commented out for testing.

#### Using #if

The easiest way to do this is with an #if 0 block:

```c
void
example()
{
    great looking code
    #if 0
    lots of code
    #endif
    more code
}
```

You can't use ​ **/**/** ​ style comments because comments can't contain comments and surely a
large block of your code will contain a comment, won't it?

Don't use #ifdef as someone can unknowingly trigger ifdefs from the compiler command line. #if
0 is that even day later you or anyone else has know idea why this code is commented out. Is it
because a feature has been dropped? Is it because it was buggy? It didn't compile? Can it be
added back? It's a mystery.

#### Use Descriptive Macro Names Instead of #if

```c
#if NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED
#if OBSOLETE
#if TEMP_DISABLED
```

#### Add a Comment to Document Why

Add a short comment explaining why it is not implemented, obsolete or temporarily disabled.

### File Extensions

In short: Use the ​ _.h_ ​ extension for header files and ​ _.c_ ​for source files.

### No Data Definitions in Header Files

Do not put data definitions in header files. for example:

```c
/*
* aheader.h
*/
int x = 0;
```

* It's bad magic to have space consuming code silently inserted through the innocent use of header files.
* It's not common practice to define variables in the header file so it will not occur to developers to look for this when there are problems.
* Consider defining the variable once in a .c file and use an extern statement to reference it.

### No Magic Numbers

A magic number is a bare naked number used in source code. It's magic because no-one has a
clue what it means including the author inside 3 months. For example:

```c
if (22 == foo) { start_thermo_nuclear_war(); }
else if (19 == foo) { refund_lotso_money(); }
else if (16 == foo) { infinite_loop(); }
else { cry_cause_im_lost(); }
```

In the above example what do 22 and 19 mean? If there was a number change or the numbers
were just plain wrong how would you know? ​Instead of magic numbers use a real name that
means something. You can use ​ _#define_ ​ or constants or enums as names. Which one is a
design choice. For example:

```c
#define PRESIDENT_WENT_CRAZY (22)
const int WE_GOOFED= 19;
enum {
    THEY_DIDNT_PAY= 16
};
if (PRESIDENT_WENT_CRAZY == foo) { start_thermo_nuclear_war(); }
else if (WE_GOOFED == foo) { refund_lotso_money(); }
else if (THEY_DIDNT_PAY == foo) { infinite_loop(); }
else {
happy_days_i_know_why_im_here(); }
```

Now isn't that better? The const and enum options are preferable because when debugging the
debugger has enough information to display both the value and the label. The #define option
just shows up as a number in the debugger which is very inconvenient. The const option has the
downside of allocating memory. Only you know if this matters for your application.

### Error Return Check Policy

* Check every system call for an error return, unless you know you wish to ignore errors.
For example, ​ printf ​ returns an error code but rarely would you check for its return code.
In which case you can cast the return to ​ (void) ​ if you really care.

* Include the system error text for every system error message.

* Check every call to malloc or realloc unless you know your versions of these calls do the
right thing. You might want to have your own wrapper for these calls, including new, so
you can do the right thing always and developers don't have to make memory checks
everywhere.
