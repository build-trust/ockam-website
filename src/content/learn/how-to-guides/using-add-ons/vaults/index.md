# Vaults

Ockam [Vault](/learn/concepts/vaults/) Add-Ons enable systems to leverage specific encryption components, specialized for a
particular environment.

While Ockam has support for a number of Vault implementations in both hardware and software, the
goal of the underlying Vault abstraction is to enable developers of all kinds to bring an optimal
implementation into an Ockam system.

See an Ockam Vault Add-On in action, in the following guide:
- [Microchip ATECC608a Add-On](/learn/how-to-guides/using-add-ons/vaults/microchip/)

[Learn more](/learn/concepts/vaults/) about Ockam's Vault concept, and reach out or make a
suggestion for an Ockam Vault Add-On [on GitHub](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/discussions/624).
