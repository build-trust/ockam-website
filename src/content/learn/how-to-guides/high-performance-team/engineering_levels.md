**Note:**

 It is assumed that an engineer at a high level would still focus on all of the attributes associated with levels that they’ve already surpassed in their career.  For example, even though "Learning" is a Level 1 | 2 focus, everyone should be on a virtuous learning cycle, even at Level 8.

 The converse is  also true. A lower level engineer is likely to check several boxes at levels 1 or 2 above their current level. This is particularly true on our small team. Everyone should have stretch tasks as part of their role.


## Anti-Patterns

**Levels 1-2:**

Poor code quality. Not self-motivated; needs someone to tell them what to do next. Constantly veers into the weeds. More inclined to blame-complain than roll up sleeves. General helplessness. Disregards team process.

**Levels 3-4:**

Disappears into projects that don’t matter to the business. Fails to identify or communicate big roadblocks. Us-vs-them attitude. Continually underestimates timelines. Doesn’t take operational excellence seriously. Solutions are more complicated than necessary.

**Levels 5:**

Arrogant jerk. Doesn’t delegate. Always says "yes" and suffers burn-out. Jumps into execution without careful consideration. Lets details slip through the cracks. Fails to raise awareness of projects at risk or people-problems. Doesn’t follow new technologies or industry trends. Thinks that some work is ‘beneath them’.

**Levels 6-8:**

Over-emphasis on scaling or high availability far beyond business needs. Spends too much time chasing the newest "shiny" technology simply to satisfy ego. Doesn’t collaborate or ask questions. Condescending. Has a “pet” agenda. Pisses off senior leadership.
